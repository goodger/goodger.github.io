Æon Flux
=========

I had heard how bad this film was supposed to be.  It was reviled by
fans of the original series of animated shorts.  Movie critics panned
the film (once they were allowed to see it; it wasn’t pre-screened).
I was ready to agree when I caught it on cable TV.

But I liked it.  It’s nowhere near perfect, but it’s not bad at all.
Never having seen the animated series, I wasn’t biased in any existing
direction.  I can understand the disappointment of true fans, but a
feature film is a different medium from experimental shorts.  The
story may be too high-concept, complex, and serious for the typical
“SF action” fan.  The action is cool, but there’s not enough of it to
call this an action movie.  The story is hard SF with ideas, set in a
utopian/dystopian future.

I hope a director’s cut is released someday; I’d love to see it.

    We’re meant to die.  It’s what makes anything about us matter.

The Alien Quadrilogy
====================

Alien_ is great horror/SF, and Aliens_ is great action/SF.  The third
and fourth films don’t really compare, but it’s nice to have them for
completeness.  (I don’t know about `AVP`; haven’t seen it yet.)  And
we’ll just overlook the fact that “quadrilogy” isn’t even a real word
(“tetralogy” is correct, if awkward).

Each of the `Alien` films has a theatrical version and an alternate or
“director’s cut”.  Runtimes and some ratings differ between the two
versions.  The information for the two versions is shown
slash-separated, as “theatrical/alternate”.

:Format: anamorphic widescreen
:Edition: “Alien Quadrilogy” boxed set (9 discs)
:Features: 2 discs per film: disc 1 contains the films with
           commentaries, and disc 2 contains featurettes and extras.
           Plus there’s an extra disk with a documentary, a Q&A with
           Ridley Scott, and archives.

       At the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown
       creature, the ship’s computer deciphers the message to be a
       warning, not a call for help.  When one of the eggs is
       disturbed, the crew do not know the danger they are in until it
       is too late.

    can’t concentrate when you do that.

    -- Jack Burton to Gracie Law

    A brave man likes the feel of nature on his face.

    *And a wise man has enough sense to get out of the rain!*

    -- Wang Chi & *Egg Shen*

    Ready? I was BORN ready.

    -- Jack Burton

    Who are these people? Friends of yours? Now this really pisses me
    off to no end!

    -- Lo Pan

    Are you crazy, is that your problem?

    -- Jack Burton

    *And Ching Dai will be happy and my curse will be lifted!*

Blade Runner
============

Brutal.  Beautiful.  Moving.  Stunning.  Compelling.  Magnificent.

A cinematic masterpiece: visuals, music, and emotion.

Many love it, others don’t get it.  It’s a classic.

I saw it in the theater in 1982, and from the first scene, the “Hades”
flyover with Vangelis’ music, I was blown away.

It’s very different in plot details from Philip K. Dick’s novel, but
it captures the essence very well (unlike most other PKD adaptations).

My copy of the “Director’s Cut” was a gift from Mayumi, spring 2003.

briefcase containing a model spinner, a plastic origami unicorn, a

The Dune Saga
=============

Although made with relatively small budgets, these well-written and
well-acted made-for-TV mini-series are a feast for the eyes and put
many big-screen SF feature films to shame.

:Genre: SF/drama/fantasy
:Format: widescreen
:Screenplay: John Harrison, from Frank Herbert’s novels


Dune
----

A deep and worthy rendition of Frank Herbert’s classic SF novel.  Its
story is far superior to the 1984 David Lynch adaptation; the story
changes required by the dramatic medium (both additions and omissions)
are quite reasonable and make sense.  At almost 5 hours, it may be too
long for non-fans though.

David Lynch’s 1984 `Dune <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/>`__ was
an interesting failure.  Although it boasted a first-rate cast,
sumptuous visuals and interesting ideas, it was far too short, leaving
much of the story untold or awkwardly altered.  Some of the
changes/additions made for Lynch’s `Dune` are wonderful (heart-plugs
and the Baron Harkonnen’s boils!), but others are obnoxious (“a
technique involving sound”?!?).  Unfortunately, it was little more
than “great scenes from the book on film”, and unintelligible unless
you’ve read the novel.

           Giannini, Julie Cox, Uwe Ochsenknecht
:Plot: In the distant future, the planet Arrakis |---| Dune |---| is
       the only source of the “spice” which gives whomever controls it
       dominion over commerce and civilization.  By way of an ancient
       prophecy, a young man realizes his destiny as Dune’s messiah
       and leads a rebellion against the corrupt galactic empire and
       forever changes the balance of power.

Children of Dune
----------------

Sequel to Dune_, combining the story lines of both `Dune Messiah`

Forrest Gump
============

Funny, sad, original, and gorgeously shot, this is one of the rare

justice.  When I later visited Hong Kong on business, I was lucky to
find it still playing in a theater.  The vistas are amazing.  Gotta
get me a big screen TV for this one some day...

The Lord of the Rings
=====================

A wondrous and awe-inspiring adaptation; Peter Jackson & crew really
did the books justice!  Taken as a whole, The Lord of the Rings is an
epic of staggering proportions, a single film with a running time of
over eleven hours that has already become a classic.  The Extended
Editions, to me, represent the definitive version of the films: more
moments, more character development, more story.

The six discs of documentaries, features, and galleries, in
combination with the multiple commentaries, are simultaneously
entertaining and informative.  They could be used as the basis of an
introductory curriculum covering all aspects of the art of filmmaking.

Film versions of beloved books often betray the source material and
aren’t worthy adaptations.  I went to see `Fellowship` the week it
opened, with some trepidation.  I was impressed by the prologue and
then delighted by Hobbiton.  By the time Gandalf handed his hat and
staff to Bilbo, I fully trusted that the technical and artistic
foundation was sound, and sat back to enjoy the story, vaguely
remembered from when I’d last read the books as a teenager.

(I intentionally refrained from re-reading the books until after I’d
seen all three films, not wanting to spoil the experience with
nit-picking.  I’m glad I did, and when I finally did read the books
again, I was impressed by just how much had been incorporated into the
films.  Dialogue and details sometimes had to be moved around or mixed
together to fit the medium, but the decision to use so much original
source material was very wise.)

These films are worthy adaptations of the books.  They’re labors of
love, and it shows.

--------------------------

This Extended Edition gives fans more of a very good thing.

:Released: 2001
:Runtime: 3h28m

The Two Towers
--------------

The Extended Edition of `The Two Towers` is essential viewing.  The
added scenes (especially the flashback with Boromir, Faramir, and
Denethor) make this a truly satisfying film, as opposeed to the merely
satisfactory theatrical release.  The real star of this film is
Gollum, and `Gollum’s Song` (over the end-titles) is heart-breaking.

:Released: 2002
:Runtime: 3h42m
:Plot: Frodo and Sam continue on to Mordor in their mission to destroy
       the One Ring, guided by Gollum.  Their former companions make
       new allies, defend Helm’s Deep from attack, and launch an
       assault on Isengard with the help of the Ents.

The Return of the King
----------------------

The Extended Edition fills in many pieces missing from the story: the
Voice of Saruman; the Paths of the Dead; the Corsairs of Umbar; more
interaction between Faramir and Denethor; the courage of Merry and
Pippin; the Witch King’s Hour; the Houses of Healing; Frodo and Sam in
the company of orcs; Aragorn and the Palantír; the Mouth of Sauron.
Although not as essential as with `The Two Towers`, the additions
restore a lot of story and character development to the theatrical
action/adventure.

:Released: 2003
:Runtime: 4h10m
:Plot: The former Fellowship of the Ring prepare for the final battle
       for Middle Earth, while Frodo & Sam approach Mount Doom to
       destroy the One Ring.

Lost In Translation
===================

In August 2009, during a vacation visiting Mayumi’s family in Japan,
we stayed at the hotel where this film was shot, the Park Hyatt Tokyo,
a five-star hotel.  We spent two nights there while exploring Tokyo

been about $600/night (!) otherwise.  Upon returning to Canada, we
felt we just had to get this movie.

Great humor & great truth.

    You know, when I was nineteen, Grandpa took me on a roller

    ride could make me so frightened, so scared, so sick, so excited,
    and so thrilled all together!  Some didn’t like it.  They went on
    the merry-go-round.  That just goes around.  Nothing.  I like the
    roller coaster.  You get more out of it.

The Terminator Series
=====================

The first and second are great.  The third is OK, and its ending
begs—almost demands—a sequel, which came in 2009.  The Governator was
only able to participate (briefly) via CG effects though.


The Terminator
--------------

Made for quite a low budget, this one could have been the epitomy of
bad B-movie SF.  But some great ideas, including an intelligent
treatment of time travel, and almost non-stop action made it a
classic.  It proves that money isn’t everything.  This one made Ahnold
famous.

Thief

The Thing
=========

A classic horror/thriller which still holds up very well.  “Who Goes
There?”, the classic SF story by John W. Campbell Jr. upon which this

cloying paranoia that the story exudes, even though it adds the
effects and gore that modern horror audiences seem to require.
