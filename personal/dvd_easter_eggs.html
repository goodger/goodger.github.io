<p>Go to the “Special Features” menu and press [Up] (or highlight “Main
Menu” and press [Down]).  The blood splatter above the words “Special
Features” will be highlighted.  Press [Enter] to see a 7 minute
featurette with the director, author Frank Miller, and producers
talking about the struggles to adapt the graphic novel to film.
Includes a proof-of-concept battle scene.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-adventures-of-buckaroo-banzai-across-the-eighth-dimension">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2">The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension!</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If you select the middle Jet Car image on the first menu screen,
you will be able to scroll through a selection of quotes from
Doctor Banzai.</li>
<li>If you select the yellow circle in the top left corner of the first
menu screen, you will be able to scroll through 36 alternate DVD
menu designs.</li>
<li>If you select the Banzai Institute logo on the Banzai Institute
Archive Menu screen, you will be able to scroll through two
alternate DVD cover designs.</li>
<li>If you select the watermelon image on the first Deleted Scenes Menu
screen, you will be taken to an article called “Food from the
Skies?” which discusses why the Banzai Institute was putting
watermelons in high gages.</li>
<li>If you select the BB logo on the second screen of the “Food from
the Skies?” article, you will be taken to a video clip of
W.D. Richter called “Why?” where he discusses watermelons and shows
a recipe for Chicken in a Watermelon.</li>
</ol>
<hr class="docutils" />
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to the Special Features menu, page 1, and access the list of
Deleted Scenes, Page 1.  While looking at the first list of 8 of the
14 deleted scenes, maneuver to highlight the [SPECIAL FEATURES] box
at the bottom middle of the screen.  Then push Left to highlight the
Watermelon.  Press Enter now and a text screen comes up: a made-up
newspaper article about Perfect Tommy’s experiment with dropping
watermelons from the sky to relieve world famine.  Press the [More
-&gt; ] box at the bottom to access the 2nd page, and go on to the 2nd
Easter Egg.</li>
<li>On the 2nd page of the news article, on the bottom left you will
see a “BB” (Buckaroo Banzai) logo.  Move the cursor Right to the [
&lt;- Back] box and then Up to the “BB” logo and press enter.  You will
then see a brief interview about the whole watermelon question, and
a bit about a recipe for “Chicken in a Watermelon”!</li>
<li>Finally, return to the main Special features menu and go to Page 2
of it.  Access the area called “Banzai Institute Archives”.  On the
bottom left you will see another “BB” logo, this time in a circular
seal.  Go down to the [Special Features] box at the bottom right of
the screen, and then move the cursor Right to highlight the
Seal.  Pressing Enter while here will display two alternate Cover
Art Inserts for the Buckaroo Banzai DVD that were discarded prior
to selecting the one used.  Interestingly, neither of the two
displayed are the one that MGM circulated just before upgrading the
Buckaroo Banzai DVD to “Special Edition” status and delaying it’s
release until Jan. 2002; so there’s at least one more alternate DVD
cover not shown in this Easter Egg!</li>
</ol>
<p>In the main menu of the DVD, there are 3 jet cars at the top of the
menu, move your cursor so that the middle on is highlighted and enter
into the quotes section of the DVD.</p>
<p>Per the “Quotes” egg, move your cursor up to the middle of the three
jet cars at the top of the screen.  (This is not as obvious as it seems
-- it takes a move <em>left</em> from the top menu item.) Now, move the
cursor left or right -- a large “light” or “knob” at the upper left of
the screen will turn green with the highlight.  Hit OK/Enter/whatever
your system uses, and see 36 or so pages of prototype DVD interfaces
that could have been, but weren’t...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aliens">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-3">Aliens</a></h1>
<p>Disc Four of the Alien Quadrilogy contains the Supplemental Material
for “Aliens”.  Go to the chapter marked “Post-Production”.  When
you’ve entered that chapter, you’ll notice a series of five (5) icons.
Press the UP button and you’ll notice the second icon will be
highlighted.  Click on that icon and you will get the featurette
entitled “A Boy and his Power-Loader”... it shows how a young man
named Van Ling built his very own power-loader based on the movie and
how it eventually got him a job working for James Cameron.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="american-splendor">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4">American Splendor</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">A “Conversation” With Toby</p>
<p>Go to the Special Features menu and just wait.  It’s set up like a
fast food drive-through with Toby in a car.  It just sounds like
the drive-through attendant trying to get Toby’s attention.
However, after a while an actual “conversation” starts between the
two using dialogue from the movie.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">DVD Credits</p>
<p>Go to Special Features, highlight the “Play Movie” icon and click
LEFT.  You’ll then highlight the “sausage/onion/cheese” icon around
the “HBO Films” feature.  Select it to see the credits for the DVD
itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A Bit About Toby Radloff</p>
<p>Again, highlight the “Play Movie” icon in Special Features.  This
time, click RIGHT.  You’ll highlight the speaker.  Select it for a
short featurette on Toby Radloff, including footage of Toby and
interviews with people who worked on the film and Harvey &amp; Joyce.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The Opening Sequence</p>
<p>Go to Chapter Select.  On the first page, you’ll be able to select
the various chapters and there will be a big panel (it’s done like
a comic book) with “American Splendor” that you can’t select right
away.  To highlight it, first highlight “Main Menu” and click DOWN.
Select the panel and you’ll get a short featurette with animator
John Kuramoto on the opening title sequence of the film.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" start="5">
<li><p class="first">The Joy of Acting</p>
<p>Again, go to Chapter Select.  This time, keep on hitting next until
you get to the screen where the End Credits are selectable.
Looking at the bottom row of icons, you’ll see the last apparently
selectable icon is “Main Menu.”  However, if you highlight “Main
Menu” and then click RIGHT, you’ll highlight an additional icon in
the shape of the previous “Next” icons.  Select it for a featurette
on Hope Davis &amp; Paul Giamatti cracking each other up on the set,
including interviews with them and behind the scenes footage.</p>

the left arrow on your remote.  A pair of eyes is highlighted on the
side of the screen.  Here you find trailers for this movie as well
as The Fly and Aliens.</li>
<li>On Disc 2, view the DVD Credits.  After the last page, you can view
some screens from the Commodore 64 Videogame “Big Trouble in Little

<div class="section" id="cars">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-8">Cars</a></h1>
<p>On the main menu, wait until after the Piston Cup rotates three times.
A Dinoco symbol will appear on the lower right of the menu.  Use your
remote to select the symbol and you’ll be transported to a scene of
McQueen and Mater at the drive-in watching themselves do a clip of

<li>On disc 1, go to Special Features, then More.  Select “Play
Introduction To Film By Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier”, and move the

bubble pops up with a hamburger in it.  Hit ENTER, and Kevin Smith

“The Good, The Bad, and The Man”, and move the selection to the

“Clerkin’ Off”.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dark-city">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-10">Dark City</a></h1>
<p>The “Find Shell Beach” game on the Dark City DVD is very vague and
difficult.  Here’s how to finish it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>At the Special Features menu, choose “To Shell Beach”.  It will tell
you to find a bloody knife.</li>
<li>Go to the Cast Menu, choose Kiefer Sutherland, and on the first page
you can see the dim outline of a knife.  Highlight it and press
“Play”.  It will tell you find the doctor’s business card.</li>
<li>Go to the Neil Gaiman section and choose “more” until you can see
the outline of a business card.  Highlight it and press “Play”.  It
will tell you to look for a picture.</li>
<li>Go to the Metropolis Comparison, choose the Original Weekly Variety
Review, and choose “more” until you see the outline of a
postcard.  Highlight it, press “Play” and it will tell you to find a
souvenir.</li>
<li>Go to the Crew Menu, choose Trevor Jones, and choose “more” until
you see the outline of a snowglobe.  Highlight it, press “Play” and
it will tell you to go find the clock.</li>
<li>Go to the Cast Menu, choose William Hurt, choose “more” until you
find the clock, highlight it, Press “Play” and then it will tell you
to find the tool that makes you what you are.  This is the sneaky
part.</li>
<li>Go to Set Designs, choose “more” until you are at the 7th picture in
(which should be a picture of a hypodermic needle), highlight the
picture and press “Play”.</li>
</ul>
<p>VOILA! You’re treated to a crummy little 15-second animated
re-creation of the final battle of the film!  Kind of a lot of work
for such little payoff.</p>
</div>

least 15 clips hidden at virtually all of the submenus also, including

play the clips at the sub-menus select the sub-menu and follow the
