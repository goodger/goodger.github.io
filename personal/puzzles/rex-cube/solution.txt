Types of pieces:

* edges (2 colors)
* centers (squares)
* petals (triangles/wedges)

Corner designations:

* |T| T: Top
* |B| B: Bottom
* |F| F: Front
* |R| R: Rear (not seen)
* |UL| UL: Upper Left
* |LL| LL: Lower Left
* |UR| UR: Upper Right
* |LR| LR: Lower Right

The icons above are used to indicate moves, along with arrows. Move
the closest part of the corner in the direction of the arrow.

1: Solve the edges of one face
==============================

Let's choose white for the first face.

Orient the cube so the white face is the top.

2: Move the white center to the white/top face
==============================================

* Move the white center to the bottom face, the side opposite the
  white edges.

* Rotate one corner with two white edges from the cube's top to the
  cube's side.

* Rotate the white center from the cube's bottom to the cube's side
  with the two white edges.

* Rotate the corner with the two white edges and white center to the
  cube's top.

* Now the top has four white edges and a white center.

3: Check parity
===============

* Orient the cube so the white face is now the bottom.

* Examine each side. Each bottom edge is white and another color. Move
  the corresponding color centers to matching bottom edge colors.

* If the final face's center can't be solved (it's on the top), do
  step 4. Otherwise, skip to step 5.

4: Fix parity
=============

* Orient the cube so the white face is now the top.

* Swap two opposite white edges:

  - |UR| |down|
  - |LR| |down|
  - |B| |right|
  - |UL| |up|
  - |LL| |up|
  - |UL| |down|
  - |R| â†¶
  - |LR| |down|
  - |UR| |up|
  
* Optional confirmation: redo steps 2 & 3.  Not necessary though, as
  we'll solve the centers later (and they'll get mixed up anyway).

5: Solve the vertical edges
===========================

* Orient the cube so the white face is now the bottom.

* Check for vertical edges that are already solved.  If none, solve
  the first edge without touching the bottom face.

* Solving the vertical edges should be pretty easy.

.. * When the next needed edge is 

6: Solve the edges of the top face
==================================

* If the top face edges are already solved, skip to step 7.

* Scenario: One top face edge is correctly positioned, one is
  incorrectly positioned with the top color on top, and the other two
  incorrectly positioned.  Three edges need to cycle:

  - Move one edge into position.
  - Move the unmoved edge into the same position.
  - Undo both moves (same moves repeated, in reverse directions).

7: Solve centers
================

Keep the white face on the bottom.

To move a center from the L face to the R face:

- |UR| |up|
- |UL| |up|
- |UR| |down|
- |UL| |down|

To move a center from the R face to the L face:

- |UL| |up|
- |UR| |up|
- |UL| |down|
- |UR| |down|

To move a center from the opposite face to the R face, position the
cube so the destination is face R, then:

- |UR| |up|
- |UL| |down|
- |UR| |down|
- |UL| |up|

If the center is on the T face and needs to move to the R face:

- |UL| |up|
- |UR| |up|
- |UL| |down|
- |UR| |down|

8: Solve petals
===============

Starting with the white face, find a white petal to move.  Set up the
cube so the white center adjoins the white petal, but opposite the
destination petal.  Remember the setup moves.  With the white center &
petal on face L, white petal adjacent to corner F, do these moves:

- Setup moves: side with petal into position, center into position

Petal group reversal moves:

- |UL| |up|
- |UR| |up|
- |UL| |down|
- |UR| |down|
- |B| |right|
- |UR| |down|
- |B| |left|
- |UR| |up|

Finally,

- Undo setup moves: center back, other side back

The petal group reversal sequence reverses the petal group
(petal-center-petal) from corners LL to F, as well as the petal group
from corners LR to F, without disturbing any other pieces.

If the petal to move is adjacent to a corner of the destination face,
turn it onto the destination face and reverse the petal group.  Or
reverse the petal group first.
