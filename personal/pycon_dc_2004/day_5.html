<p>Woke up around 5am, tried to get another precious hour of sleep, but
no luck.  Met another PyCon-goer, Nestor Nissen of Germany, when I was
on my way out of the bathroom after brushing my teeth, and he was on
his way in.  I was wearing my black staff PyCon shirt.</p>
<p>Arrived at PyCon at 7:15am, ran around setting up schedules and
helping out wherever I could.  I manned the registration desk from 8
to 9; met a lot of people.  Bill Sconce had his stuffie python, Eric,
on the registration table, so I made a name badge for him.  Was
wearing my name badge with &quot;Docutils&quot; plus a &quot;FOR HIRE&quot; badge, which
got some response.  Talked to a recruiter after Mitch Kapor's keynote
address.</p>
<p>Anthony Baxter's talk, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/6/">&quot;Scripting Language&quot; My Arse: Using Python for
Voice over IP</a>, was a
lot of fun.  Attended <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/52/">Andrew Koenig's talk</a> &amp; Andrew Kuchling's
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/12/">Quixote tutorial</a>,
both good.</p>
<p>Lunch was fine, met Thomas Wouters, Neil Norwitz, Neil Schemenauer,
and others.  Made a BOF session schedule board, then went to buy some
socks at Gap.  Caught Jacob Hallen's PyPy talk; interesting work.</p>
<p>Did a bit more sprinting, then held the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/DocutilsBof">Docutils Birds-of-a-Feather
session</a> at 8pm.  About 20 people showed up.  I described the
results from the sprint, then opened the floor for discussion.  Got
some good ideas too.</p>
<p>Walked back to the hostel with Tamer Fahmy, talking about
middle-eastern politics among other subjects.  He worked on his
slide show for Thursday's session; Nester arrived and we critiqued.  My
advice: fewer words, more talking, and show the pretty pictures as
early as possible.  We seem to have convinced him.</p>
<p>Met an Italian couple as I was getting ready for bed, who couldn't
speak much English.  Tried French and Japanese, but their &quot;little
English&quot; was all we had in common.  I bid them &quot;buena notte&quot;.</p>
