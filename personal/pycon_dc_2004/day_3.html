<p>The watch's alarm didn't wake me up, possibly because I was wearing
it, and I was bundled up under the covers.  I woke up a few minutes
later anyway.</p>
<p>Was cold this morning, so I was glad for my sweater, scarf, hat &amp;
gloves.  A lot more traffic on Monday morning than Saturday &amp; Sunday.</p>
<p>Mike Orr joined the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/DocutilsSprint">Docutils sprint</a> for the morning; he and Reggie
began working on an API for document fragments, particularly HTML.  By
evening, Reggie Dugard had made good progress, almost complete.  Aahz
seems to be making steady strides with his FrameMaker writer, and Matt
Gilbert with MoinMoin integration.  Ian Bicking was back with us after
attending the Zope tutorial yesterday, but Oliver Rutherfurd is at
work today.  Ed Loper and Bill Sconce also continued hacking on
DocPy/LaTeX; Steve Holden is now busy with conference matters.</p>
<p>For lunch, Reggie and I visited the conference building's food court,
and impressive place with a dozen or so vendors, from Burger King and
Taco Bell to Crepes and Chinese.  We settled on Chinese; I had sweet &amp;
hot chicken on rice.  We got big helpings; again I wasn't hungry for
dinner.  There were some kind of peppers in the food and I ate one by
accident.  Hot!</p>
