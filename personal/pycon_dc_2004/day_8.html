<p>It was raining this morning.  Packed up and left the hostel at 9am,
took a bus down to a metro station then on to Pentagon City.  I'm not
sure, but I think the &quot;Fashion Center&quot; mall there may have been the
mall in <a class="reference external" href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0181689">Minority Report</a>, and
possibly also in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093640">No Way Out</a>.
Bought a &quot;PFC&quot; -- portable folding cart -- for my bags because I was
getting tired and sore carrying them around.  A couple more wee
gifties for the kids.  Visited the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bang-olufsen.com/">Bang &amp; Olufsen</a> store, and fantasized.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the street -- reachable via a metro underpass
-- was another mall, not so upscale.  Browsed around a Borders
book/CD/DVD/coffee store, and a Best Buy.  Then it was time to get to
the airport, 2 stops away.</p>
<p>Got my boarding pass, and two last-minute gifts: a nice bookmark for
my wife, and a black &amp; yellow &quot;jungle carpet python&quot; plushie, for my
kids.  And for me, too, I guess -- I'll name it &quot;Monty&quot; and it'll be a
cousin to Eric, the conference mascot brought by Bill Sconce.  A
Cinnabon later, and it was time to get to the gate.  Spent my last 90
US cents on some mints -- no currency to carry home.</p>
<p>On takeoff I had a good view of the Pentagon, and I see the need for
so much security.  The airport is literally a stone's throw away, and
a last-minute course correction would be (and was) deadly.  I wonder
if security is the reason why, on both arrival in and departure from
DC, the plane wasn't brought all the way to the jetway.  Passengers
had to go down a flight of stairs to the tarmac and back up.</p>
<p>As I write this on the plane, I look back on the last week as an
unmitigated success.  I met loads of people I'd only ever exchanged
email with before, and plenty others new to me.  It's amazing the
places my software has gotten to -- rumored to be in use at NASA, the
NSA, the OSAF, and I'm sure at many other companies and organizations
large and small.  I guess Docutils and reStructuredText have hit a
sweet spot.</p>
<p>Warms my heart.</p>
