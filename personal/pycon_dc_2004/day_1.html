<p>Woke up around 6:20 without an alarm.  Pretty good, considering that
last night, somebody started a party nearby with loud, booming
reggae/dance music.  Earplugs to the rescue.</p>
<p>Showered, changed and ate -- hostel-provided toast &amp; jelly and fake
orange juice.  Brushed my teeth and set off for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gwu.edu/">George Washington
University</a>.</p>
<p>The city is very quiet at 7:20am on a Saturday.  The walk took me
about 35 minutes, over 3 kilometers (2 miles).  It's warmer today; I
could open my jacket and didn't really need my gloves or hat.</p>
<p>Arrived at the <a class="reference external" href="http://gwired.gwu.edu/cafritz/">Cafritz Conference Center</a> just before 8am.  A few people
were already there -- Michael McLay, Ted Leung, Brian Dorsey, and Bill
Sconce.  I helped set up the tables, extension cords, and network
cables.  People trickled in over the morning, becoming a good-size
group.  I met the (former) PythonLabs crew: Barry Warsaw, Fred Drake,
Guido van Rossum, Jeremy Hylton, and Tim Peters.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/DocutilsSprint">Docutils sprint</a> began with Oliver Rutherfurd and Matt Gilbert.
I did a walk-through of the architecture &amp; the code, beginning with
<a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sf.net/spec/pep-0258.html#docutils-project-model">PEP 258's block diagram</a>.
Soon more people arrived though, including Aahz, Fred Drake, Bill
Sconce, Steve Holden (our most esteemed conference organizer), and Ian
Bicking.  Oliver began working on his DocBook writer, Matt &amp; Fred on
MoinMoin integration, Steve &amp; Bill on a DocPy/LaTeX writer, Aahz on a
FrameMaker writer and generic stylesheet ideas, and Ian on the Python
Source reader.  Andrew Kuchling joined us in the afternoon to write a
directive for the ABC music language.  We transferred lots of
knowledge and made some progress on the code.</p>
<p>Around 1pm lunch discussions began.  Aahz forced the issue by standing
up and saying something like, &quot;Anybody who wants lunch stand up; let's
go.&quot;  We ate at a Thai place on Pennsylvania Avenue.  Very nice.  Then
back to the sprint.</p>
<p>Although I own a laptop, I didn't bring it to the conference for
several reasons.  My wife is working on a project and needs it; I
didn't want to have to worry about breaking it or having it stolen;
and I figured as sprint coach I ought not to be concentrating on my
own code, but on the sprinters'.  That last reason turned out to be
the most significant.  My lack of computer meant that I was an
accessible consultant to all.  I'd recommend this strategy to future
sprint coaches.</p>
<p>Sprinters started taking their leave in the afternoon.  Ian and I were
the last in our sprint room; we left at 6:30pm, asking the 15 or so
people in the other room to have building management lock the doors.</p>
<p>Ian and I took a walk through the city, up to Adams-Morgan, where I'm
staying.  We had dinner at a Middle Eastern restaurant at the corner
of 18th and Florida -- not bad at all, spicy &amp; cheap.  We walked
through the Saturday evening crowds, but neither of us being clubbers,
did not join in.  I left him at the Woodley Park-Zoo metro station,
with its long, looooooong escalators.  I returned to WISC, taking the
scening route, and found a good deal at the local Blockbuster store.</p>
<p>Back at WISC now, writing this up.  Think I'll turn in early tonight.</p>
