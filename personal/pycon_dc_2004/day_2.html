<p>Woke around 7:20.  Loud music again last night, but earplugs did the
trick.  A brisk, windy morning, an a 30 minute walk to PyCon.  On the
way, I noticed a building being build at the corner of 21st and K (I
think).  Affixed was a sign: &quot;Hitt Contracting&quot;.  Amusing.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/DocutilsSprint">Docutils sprint</a>: Ed Loper has arrived this morning, to work on
<a class="reference external" href="http://epydoc.sf.net">Epydoc</a> integration.  Tracy Ruggles worked
with him.  Laura Creighton and Jacob Hallen joined us, but pressing
business seems to have arisen.  Reggie Dugard worked on a Table of
Contents bug, mostly as a learning exercise.  Matt Gilbert made good
progress on MoinMoin integration, as did Aahz with his FrameMaker
writer, Oliver Rutherfurd with his DocBook writer, and Steve Holden &amp;
Bill Sconce with DocPy/LaTeX.</p>
<p>For lunch, Matt, Tracy, Ed, Reggie, and I went to an Italian place
across the street.  Was good, and filling; became my main meal of the
day.</p>
<p>I was the last one out, after asking the building manager to lock up
our room.  Bought a watch at CVS (the pharmacy, not the code
repository) on the way back to the hostel, for the alarm.</p>
