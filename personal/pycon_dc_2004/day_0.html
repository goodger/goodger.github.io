<p>6:30am -- Left home after saying goodbye to my wife &amp; kids.  I'll miss
them; hope they miss me too!</p>
<p>7am -- Arrived at Pierre Elliott Trudeau (formerly Dorval)
International Airport.  Got my boarding pass from a kiosk with my
credit card.  Neat.  Checked one bag, but the new security requires me
to carry it through US customs &amp; immigration.  Then, because my
destination was Reagan National Airport, a security guard pawed
through my <em>checked</em> bag and sent it through X-ray.  Fine.</p>
<p>But when I got to the gate, I had to undergo another search with a
hand-held metal detector, including my shoes.  My carry-on, jacket,
and wallet were searched too.</p>
<p>I feel safe now.</p>
<p>10:30am -- Arrived in DC after an uneventful flight.  Took the metro
in to Dupont Circle, but I should've gone one further -- long walk.
In the metro, I kept hearing the PA system saying &quot;George Clinton&quot;.  I
finally realized I was misunderstanding &quot;doors closing&quot; through a poor
speaker system.</p>
<p>Checked in at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtondchostel.com">Washington International Student Center</a> (WISC)
by a Japanese guy named Tomo, with whom I had a nice conversation.
WISC is a hostel, very no-frills.  Each room has 3 sets of triple bunk
beds, everything needs a paint job, but the bathrooms are clean.
Can't beat $22/night, breakfast included (toast, jelly, and cheap
&quot;citrus punch&quot;).</p>
<p>12:30pm -- Made my bed, dropped off my stuff, and headed in to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://smithsonian.org/visit/infocenter/dcmuseum.htm">Smithsonian museums</a>.  Tomo noted
that pattern: whereas Americans usually wanted to see the White House
first, Canadians tended toward the Smithsonian.  I did the geekiest
two: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nasm.si.edu/">Air &amp; Space</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/">Natural History</a>.  Apollo capsule, moon lander, Saturn V
engines -- very cool.  Hope diamond, crystals and mineral formations
-- amazingly beautiful.</p>
<p>I consider this an &quot;advance scout&quot; mission for the day when my whole
family visits.  That happened once before, when I went to France on
business and had a free day in Paris.  Saw all the major sights --
from the outside.  Didn't have time to wait in line to get in.</p>
<p>Washington's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nps.gov/nama/">National Mall</a> is a lot
like the Champs Elysee in Paris.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nps.gov/wash/">Washington Monument</a> was closed by the time I got there, but
it's so huge that didn't really matter.</p>
<p>I was a bit disappointed that the Reflecting Pool was empty.  I wanted
to do the &quot;Forrest?&quot; &quot;Jenny?&quot; &quot;Forrest!&quot; &quot;Jenny!&quot; scene or at least
imagine it, but no luck.</p>
<p>The new <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wwiimemorial.com">World War II Memorial</a>,
around the Rainbow Pool, looks quite impressive.  Almost ready to
open.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nps.gov/linc/">Lincoln Memorial</a> was most
impressive.  I'd never read the entire Gettysburg Address, so it was
moving to read it carved into the wall.</p>
<p>Next, I visited the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nps.gov/kowa/">Korean War Veterans Memorial</a> -- very moving.  Especially reading
these words carved into the wall: &quot;Freedom Is Not Free&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nps.gov/vive/">Vietnam Veterans Memorial</a> was
particularly moving.  I know no one who fought in Vietnam or lost a
relative or friend there, but still I felt tears welling up.  The
names just go on and on.  What a waste of life, on both sides.  War
has no winners, only losers, but the price must be paid from time to
time.</p>
<p>Back to WISC, dropped off the Smithsonian gifts for the wife &amp; kids.
Then off to Best Buy to check out DVDs.  I found a few that were good
deals, considering the exchange rate.  But only a few.  Most had the
same price point in US dollars as in Canadian, favoring the Canadian
consumer.</p>
<p>10pm -- Back at WISC now.  Had no dinner, but don't feel hungry.  Had
a Polish sausage between Smithsonian museums around 2:30.</p>
<p>I'll be heading for bed soon.  I don't have an alarm clock or watch for
the morning, but I should be able to wake up in time.</p>
<p>I noticed that DC is a jaywalking town, much like Montreal.  Warms my
heart.</p>
