Woke around 7:20.  Loud music again last night, but earplugs did the
trick.  A brisk, windy morning, an a 30 minute walk to PyCon.  On the
way, I noticed a building being build at the corner of 21st and K (I
think).  Affixed was a sign: "Hitt Contracting".  Amusing.

`Docutils sprint`_: Ed Loper has arrived this morning, to work on
`Epydoc <http://epydoc.sf.net>`__ integration.  Tracy Ruggles worked
with him.  Laura Creighton and Jacob Hallen joined us, but pressing
business seems to have arisen.  Reggie Dugard worked on a Table of
Contents bug, mostly as a learning exercise.  Matt Gilbert made good
progress on MoinMoin integration, as did Aahz with his FrameMaker
writer, Oliver Rutherfurd with his DocBook writer, and Steve Holden &
Bill Sconce with DocPy/LaTeX.

For lunch, Matt, Tracy, Ed, Reggie, and I went to an Italian place
across the street.  Was good, and filling; became my main meal of the
day.

I was the last one out, after asking the building manager to lock up
our room.  Bought a watch at CVS (the pharmacy, not the code
repository) on the way back to the hostel, for the alarm.
