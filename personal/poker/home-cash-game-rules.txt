**Version 8, updated 2018-06-21.**

We use “`Robert’s Rules of Poker, version 11`_” as the basis of our
house rules, as applicable, and as modified by the clarifications and
exceptions that comprise the remainder of this document. We typically
play No-Limit Texas Hold’em.

I am a member of the `“Minneapolis Rounders” poker meetup group`__. My
home games are posted on the group’s calendar, and seat reservations
are available through the group. Membership is free, and there’s no
charge for games — and no rake! The `Rounders Rules & Etiquette`__
also apply.

Have Fun!
=========

**Poker is a game, and games should be fun, win or lose.**

**Only play poker with money you can easily afford to lose.**

**No grudges shall be held.**

Bottom line: if you’re not enjoying yourself at the poker table, maybe
you should stop for a while; do something else that you find
enjoyable. If you are having fun, great — let’s play!


Friendly & Fair — With Common Sense
===================================

**We aim to play a friendly, fair game.** People sometimes make
mistakes. When an irregularity that is material to the game arises it
will be discussed and, if possible, resolved using common sense in the
spirit of fairness. If agreement cannot be reached quickly and
amicably, these rules are the final word.


Home Game: Reservations & No-Show Policy
========================================

This is a home game. You are a guest in a private home, so please act
accordingly.

**When you reserve a seat at a game, you commit to playing in that
game.**
Reserving a seat then not showing up hurts the game and is
disrespectful to the host and to the other players.
If something comes up and you can’t play, **you MUST inform the host
ASAP**.
Failure to do so risks not being welcome in future (e.g. your
reservation may be bumped or deleted).
Life happens, but no-shows can prevent other willing players (i.e.
people on the waiting list) from playing and can shorten games — very
uncool.

In a cash game, it’s okay to join the game late.
Just be sure to let the host know of your plans (and changes to
plans!) ASAP.

The host reserves the right to prioritize reservations and give
preferential treatment.


Miscellaneous
=============

* **No smoking** in the house. Smokers, please exhale fully, outside,
  before re-entering the house.

  \

* **No standing/urinal use of the toilet**. Drop trou & sit, men! I’m
  tired of cleaning up after drunkards with bad aim.

* Please **remove your shoes at the door**.

* Players must take care to **keep drinks from spilling on the
  table**.

* Players must take care to **keep the cards and chips clean** — no
  sticky, dirty, or greasy fingers (so no sticky, greasy, or messy
  food at the table).

* **Show one, show all.** If a player shows cards to another player
  during or after a hand, any player at the table has the right to see
  those exposed cards after the hand is over. It’s best not to share
  mucked cards.

* **No discussion of the hand in play until the action is complete.**
  Exception: if there are only two people in the hand (heads up), they
  may discuss the hand as they wish. Absolutely no discussion of the
  hand in play if you are not involved in the hand.

* **Don’t delay the game:**

  - **Avoid mobile phone use during a hand.** Let it go to voicemail,
    or fold. Long telephone conversations should take place away from
    the table.

  - **Shuffling and dealing and playing take priority over stacking.**
    After a win if it’s your turn to shuffle or deal or play your
    hand, just move your chips out of the way quickly and get on with
    it. Stack your chips only after you’re done shuffling or dealing
    or playing.

  - **At the showdown, turn over BOTH cards without delay.** (See
    “`The Showdown`_” below for the order.)

  - **Rabbit hunting is discouraged.** It slows down the game.

* **Keep your highest value chips visible at the front of your
  stack**, so that other players can quickly estimate your chip
  total. Don’t hide high-value chips behind the rest of your stack.

* **Keep your cards visible**, on the table, in front of your chip
  stack.  Don’t hide your cards behind your stack, don’t take your
  cards off the table, and don’t cover your cards completely with your
  hands.

* **Use a chip or a card capper (card guard) to protect your cards.**
  If your cards enter the muck, even accidentally, they’re dead.

* **Don’t splash the pot.** Place your bet immediately in front of
  your cards, well separated from the pot.

* Please **help out when you can** (especially players seated at the
  middle of the table, when we don’t have a dedicated dealer).

  - When the button is at the end of the table, it can be hard to
    pitch the cards. Dealers, please pitch the cards as far as you’re
    comfortable, and players, push the cards along.

  - Push the chips into the center to form a pot **once the betting is
    over**.

  - Push the discards into a single muck pile, but be careful not to
    muck anybody’s live cards or expose any cards.

  - Return the cards to the dealer at the end of the hand.

  - Push the chips to the winner.

* Seating is first-come, first-served.

* When playing on **two tables**:

  - Up to 11 players play at the large/main table.

  - The arrival of a 12th player splits the game into two 6-player
    tables. Players may volunteer to move, or we’ll draw for seats.
    The host/banker doesn’t move.

  - Newcomers go to the table with fewer players.

  - When the two tables become unbalanced (a difference of two or more
    players), one or more players from the larger (more populous)
    table must move to the other table: a volunteer, or the player who
    will next take the big blind position, moves to the
    equivalent-or-later position at the smaller table.

  - Any player may request a **table change**.
    A player may only move if no player imbalance will result (e.g.
    when there are more people at the player’s current table, after
    sufficient additional players arrive, or after sufficient players
    leave the other table).

  - When 10 or fewer players remain, the two tables merge and a new
    dealer/button is determined by draw.

* **Players should announce their intention to leave the game** at
  least one round (or half an hour) ahead. Exception: busted players
  may leave at any time and are not forced to re-buy.

* Gross misunderstandings: see `RROPv11 § 14 “No-Limit and Pot-Limit”,
  § “No-Limit Rules”, rule 12`__.

Stakes
======

* **Table stakes**, chips only, no cash.

  Exception: cash on the table may “play behind”, with declaration
  (e.g. when buying chips), **before** looking at your hole cards.

* Typical buy-ins: minimum is 20 big blinds, maximum is the greater of
  100 (sometimes 200) big blinds or the size of the big stack
  (approximately). The game may specify different buy-in limits, or
  the players may agree on different buy-ins. The limits must be made
  clear at the outset.

* **Buy-ins are cash only**, no credit.

* **No ratholing.** Chips must remain in play until a player cashes
  out.

* Each player is responsible for verifying that their chip count and
  the banker’s chip count and the final payout all match.
  Any discrepancies must be addressed immediately.


Blinds
======

* **We use the “dead button” rule** (continuity of blinds). The
  alternative, the “forward moving button” rule, is fairer but is too
  complicated to implement and slows down the game. `Explanations of
  both rules can be found here
  <http://learn.pokernews.com/news/2013/10/a-look-at-house-rules-more-button-rules-2085.htm>`__
  `and here.
  <http://blog.nexuspoker.com/2011/11/dead-button-vs-moving-button-poker.html>`__

* New players entering a game-in-progress are **not** required to post
  a big blind.

* Players with missed blinds who wish to rejoin the game must either
  post one of each missed blind or wait for (and pay) the big blind or
  straddle.

  When both blinds are posted, the small blind is dead (added to the
  pot) and is not part of a bet.

* **“Buy the button” rule**: A new or returning player may only enter the
  game between the button and the small blind (one hand early) by
  *buying the button*. The new player posts both the big blind (live)
  and the small blind (dead, in the pot) in place of the two players
  to his/her left, who take a one-hand break from posting blinds. On
  the next hand, the player who just bought the button gets the button
  (and the deal) and play continues normally. Everyone ends up posting
  one of each blind, as usual.

* If a player is absent when it is their turn to act, their hand is
  dead and they forfeit their blind, if any. Exception: be lenient
  with the host/banker when they’re otherwise busy.

* **Live straddle bets are allowed**, before looking at cards (ideally
  before any cards are dealt), doubling for each position, up to and
  including the player on the button: the first straddle is to the
  left of and double the big blind, the next straddle is double that
  (so 4 times the big blind, a “double straddle”), then 8 times
  (“triple straddle”), etc. **The full amount of the last straddle is
  also the minimum raise in the pre-flop betting round.**

  Sleeper straddles and Mississippi straddles are **not** allowed,
  because they’re too obscure and confusing (requiring explanations
  that slow down the game), and they tend to piss off the other
  players. Live straddles are bad enough.


Dealing
=======

* How to shuffle, cut, and deal properly: see `HowToShuffle.com
  <http://www.howtoshuffle.com/>`_ and/or `TruePokerDealer.com
  <http://truepokerdealer.com/>`_ (or their `YouTube channel
  <https://www.youtube.com/user/truepokerdealer/videos>`__).

* In player-dealt games, we may use two decks and “**shuffle behind**”
  (a.k.a. “clean up your own mess”) to speed up play:

  - Use two decks of cards (with different color backs) on alternating
    hands. The decks leapfrog each other around the table.

  - When a hand is over, the dealer of that hand shuffles the cards
    they just finished dealing, preparing the deck for the next hand.

  - The dealer of a new hand receives a deck of already-shuffled cards
    from the player two positions to his/her right.

  - The dealer cuts the deck, because the player now in the cutoff
    position is busy shuffling. (Variation: ask the player in the
    small blind to cut.)

  See alternate explanations & variations at `chiptalk.net`__ and
  `pokersmasher.com`__.

  __ http://www.pokersmasher.com/poker-strategy/to-use-two-decks-in-poker-home-games.html

* **Cut** the deck with one hand only.
  Place the shuffled deck on the table.
  Place the cut card in front of the deck.
  (A “cut card” is an opaque plastic card used to hide the bottom card
  from accidental view.)
  Lift a significant number of cards (between ⅓ and ⅔ of the deck)
  from the top of the deck and place them onto the cut card.
  Using the same hand, lift the remaining cards off the table and
  place them onto the cards already on top of the cut card.

* **Absent players** who have paid all their blinds for that round
  should be dealt in.
  Absent players with missed blinds should not be dealt in.

  When the action comes around to an absent player, their hand will be
  mucked regardless of their position or blinds paid.

  Dealing an absent player in or out does not cause a misdeal.

* **Deal cards flat and low to the table** in order to avoid exposing
  cards.

* **Misdeals** occur when any two hole cards are exposed, or when the
  initial hole card of either of the first two players (small blind or
  big blind) is exposed.

  If a single hole card is exposed, the rest of the cards stay in
  play, the exposed card becomes the first burn card (placed face-up
  on top of the deck after the deal), and the card that would have
  been the first burn card replaces the exposed card.

* Place the **burn cards**, face down, near the board (the community
  cards) and separated from the general muck (typically, under the
  chips in the pot or under the button). This way, the number of burn
  cards is evident to all.

* **Never burn a card early**; always wait until you are ready to deal
  the board card(s), and *then* burn. Removing a burn card early
  defeats the purpose of the burn card: to hide the back of the next
  board card in case there is a distinguishing mark. Also, burning a
  card early can result in confusion.

* **Do not deal any board cards early** (face-up *or*
  face-down!). Even dealing face-down may expose the value of a card
  through a distinguishing mark on the card back. If you need to leave
  the table, ask a neighbor to finish the deal for you.

* See `Poker Board Cards
  <http://www.howtoshuffle.com/poker-board-cards.htm>`_ for details.


Betting
=======

* The minimum opening bet is one big blind. The minimum raise is the
  greater of the size of the initial bet or the previous raise in that
  betting round. Exception: all-in wagers.

  Example 1: with 25¢/50¢ blinds, players may call for 50¢ or raise to
  a minimum total of $1. After a raise to $1, the next raise is to a
  minimum total of $1.50 (a $1 call plus another 50¢ raise).

  Example 2: post-flop, the first bet is $1, followed by a raise to $5
  total (a raise **of** $4). The minimum for a subsequent re-raise is
  $9 total (a $5 call plus another $4 raise).

* **An all-in wager of less than a full raise does not (by itself)
  reopen the betting to a player who has already acted.**

  Example: post-flop, 3-handed. Player A bets $10, Player B calls,
  Player C raises all-in to $16 total. Neither Player A nor Player B
  may re-raise immediately, as Player C’s all-in wager was not a full
  re-raise.

* **Place your bets in front of your cards**, separate from the
  pot. **No splashing the pot** (tossing chips into the pot).

* **No string bets.** Raises must be declared before any chips are
  placed, or the total bet (call + raise) must be placed in one
  motion.

  Exception: Placing a multiple-chip bet consisting of a full bet plus
  at least half a full raise is the same as announcing a raise, and
  the minimum raise must be completed. With less than half a full
  raise, the excess chips must be pulled back.

* **Declare your bets and raises!** Without declaration, a wager is
  the full amount of the chip(s) played.

* **Single chip rule.**
  After a bet, putting a single chip into the pot without declaration
  is a call, regardless of denomination.

* **Verbal declarations are binding** (“fold”, “check”, “bet”, “call”,
  “raise”, amount of bet). Raises should be specific. Acceptable raise
  phrases: “raise, X more”, “raise, plus X”, “raise, X on top”,
  “raise, Y total”, “raise, Y to go”, “raise to Y”, “raise, make it
  Y”, “raise, Y all day”. Just saying “raise Z” is ambiguous — are you
  raising *to* Z or raising Z *more*?

* **Wait to take change.** When calling or betting without exact
  chips, don’t take change immediately from the pot or from another
  player’s active bet; this can be very confusing, e.g. when there’s a
  raise after taking change. Take change from the pot only after the
  betting is complete, and make your actions clear.


All-In
======

When no further action is possible after one or more players are
all-in:

* The players are free to open their hands or keep their hole cards
  hidden, their choice.

  \

* The players may agree to “`run it twice`__” (a.k.a. “deal twice”:
  deal the remainder of the board cards twice, and split the pot) or
  come to some other arrangement (run it three times, etc.).

  __ http://poker.wikia.com/wiki/Running_it_twice


The Showdown
============

* The player who made the last aggressive action on the final betting
  round (the river in Hold’em) must open his/her hand first.
  If the final round was checked down, the first player on the
  dealer’s left (earliest position player) must open first.

* To win any part of a pot, **both hole cards must be shown**.

* **No slow rolls:** turn over both hole cards together and without
  delay.

* **The cards speak,** regardless of verbal declarations of hands.

  - Players are responsible for reading hands and determining the
    winner.

  - Any player, in the hand or not, may (and should) speak up
    **immediately** if they think a mistake is being made in the
    reading of hands.

  - If a player verbally declares their hand, the winning hole cards
    must still be shown.

    If a player miscalls their hand, causing opponent(s) to muck,
    the miscalled hand is automatically disqualified — even if the
    mucked hand(s) can be retrieved.

* **Retrieving mucked cards.**
  Players may retrieve their cards immediately after mucking by
  mistake, but only if their cards are clearly identifiable.
  This is a privilege that may be revoked if abused.

* In the case of a split pot, after splitting evenly, any odd chips go
  to the first players clockwise after the button/dealer.


..
  Optional (Non-Standard) Rules
  =============================

  These non-standard rules must be discussed and agreed upon by all
  players beforehand. **By default, these rules are NOT in force.**

  - Players may “**cash-down**” (remove chips from play) above 200 big
    blinds, between hands, with declaration. Removed chips can be
    reintroduced later (also between hands, with declaration).
