<p>These are quotes I have collected from all over (books, web sites,
mailing lists, media), on a variety of topics.  The one thing they all
have in common is that they struck a chord of some kind.  They
triggered my truth perception center, tickled my funny bone, or
touched me in some way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The peculiar evil genius of Amazon is that Amazon seems to be
trying to simultaneously establish a wholesale monopsony and a
retail monopoly in the ebook sector.</p>
<p>The real driver for piracy is the lack of convenient access to
desirable content at a competitive price.</p>
<p>By foolishly insisting on DRM, and then selling to Amazon on a
wholesale basis, the publishers handed Amazon a monopoly on their
customers — and thereby empowered a predatory monopsony.</p>
<p>If the major publishers switch to selling ebooks without DRM, then
they can enable customers to buy books from a variety of outlets
and move away from the walled garden of the Kindle store. They see
DRM as a defense against piracy, but piracy is a much less
immediate threat than a gigantic multinational with revenue of $48
Billion in 2011 (more than the entire global publishing industry)
that has expressed its intention to “disrupt” them, and whose
chief executive said recently “even well-meaning gatekeepers slow
innovation” (where “innovation” is code-speak for “opportunities
for me to turn a profit”).</p>

<p>Good ideas are like butterflies: they may land, but they soon take

<p class="attribution">&mdash;Brian Luke Seaward, <cite>Managing Stress</cite></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ideas are like soap bubbles.  They can pop or float away so
easily.  Then they’re gone forever.</p>
<p>One idea leads to another, like bubbles coming out together.
... The trick is to catch them before they disappear.</p>
<p>Never trust your memory.  All too often what seems like a
marvelous idea at midnight is gone in the morning.</p>
<p>Write them down.  ...  Do whatever you have to do to hold onto an
idea until you have time to sit down at your desk with it and see
where it goes. Even if most ideas turn out to be like the little
bubbles that break as soon as they hit the air, don’t let them
go. You never know which bit of nonsense will turn out to be the
bubble that floats all the way to heaven.</p>

<p>The old and powerful never want to let go.  They always think

<blockquote>
<p>And the greatest arrogance of all: “save the planet.” What? Are
these fucking people kidding me? Save the planet, we don’t even
know how to take care of ourselves yet. We haven’t learned how to
care for one another, we’re gonna save the fucking planet?</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with the planet. The planet is fine. The
<strong>people</strong> are fucked. ... Compared to the people, the planet is
doing great. ... The planet has been here four and a half billion
years. We’ve been here, what, a hundred thousand?  Maybe two
hundred thousand? And we’ve only been engaged in heavy industry
for a little over two hundred years. Two hundred years versus four
and a half billion.  And we have the <em>conceit</em> to think that
somehow we’re a threat? That somehow we’re gonna put in jeopardy
this beautiful little blue-green ball that’s just a-floatin’
around the sun?</p>
<p>...  The planet isn’t going anywhere. <strong>We are!</strong> ... The
planet’ll shake us off like a bad case of fleas. ...</p>
<p>The planet will be here for a long, long, <strong>long</strong> time after
we’re gone, and it will heal itself, it will cleanse itself,
’cause that’s what it does. It’s a self-correcting system. The air
and the water will recover, the earth will be renewed, and if it’s
true that plastic is not degradable, well, the planet will simply
incorporate plastic into a new pardigm: the Earth plus plastic.
The Earth doesn’t share our prejudice towards plastic. Plastic
came out of the Earth. The Earth probably sees plastic as just
another one of its children. Could be the only reason the Earth
allowed us to be spawned from it in the first place. It wanted
plastic for itself. Didn’t know how to make it. Needed us. Could
be the answer to our age-old egocentric philosophical question,
“Why are we here?” <em>Plastic, assholes.</em></p>

<p>Obscurity, not piracy, is the biggest problem writers face. In the
21st century, if you are not making art with the intention of it
being copied, you are not making contemporary art.</p>
<p>It’s how we all learn to do stuff. That’s how we are, we are
descendants of molecules formed a million years ago because they
figured out how to replicate themselves. We have a name for things
that don’t copy themselves: dead.</p>

<p><strong>Uncritical thinking kills</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing [a parent] can do for [their children] is
to teach [them] how to live in the real world.  And that means
showing [them] how to think. Not <em>what</em> to think, but <em>how</em>.</p>
<p>Question authority. Be skeptical of claims. Ask for
evidence. Apply good logic. Avoid bad logic. Analyze the
results. Look for bias.</p>
<p>And doubt. Doubt <em>doubt</em> <strong>doubt</strong>. It’s one of the greatest
strengths of the human mind, and perhaps the least used of all.</p>
<p>Too many people choose not to think. But our technology, our
society, our impact is vast, and now, <em>today</em>, in <em>this</em> world,

<p>As our society grows more dependent on computers, the software we
run is of critical importance to securing the future of a free
society. Free software is about having control over the technology
we use in our homes, schools and businesses, where computers work
for our individual and communal benefit, not for proprietary
software companies or governments who might seek to restrict and
monitor us.</p>

<p>Digital rights management always converges on malware.</p>
<p>As a member of the Walkman generation, I have made peace with the
fact that I will require a hearing aid long before I die, and of
course, it won’t be a hearing aid, it will be a computer I put in
my body. So when I get into a car (a computer I put my body into)
with my hearing aid (a computer I put inside my body) I want to
know that these technologies are not designed to keep secrets from
me, and to prevent me from terminating processes on them that work
against my interests.</p>
<p>Freedom in the future will require us to have the capacity to
monitor our devices and set meaningful policy on them, to examine
and terminate the processes that run on them, to maintain them as
honest servants to our will, and not as traitors and spies working
for criminals, thugs, and control freaks.</p>

<p>Proprietary software is an unsafe building material.</p>
<p>You can’t inspect it.  You can’t assess its complex failure modes
easily, by simply poking at the finished article.  And most
important of all, if you were aware of a [safety] problem ... that
you could fix, you couldn’t fix it.  If you were aware of a
catastrophic failure mode, you couldn’t do anything about it --
except ask the manufacturer to fix it... who sells software to
consumers under shrinkwrap... which basically says, “if the
software fails catastrophically and obliterates your town, we’ll
give you your money back.”</p>
<p>So proprietary software is an unsafe building material.  We
shouldn’t use it for purposes that could conceivably cause harm,
like running personal computers.  Let alone should we use it for
things like anti-lock brakes or throttle control in automobiles.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t allow people to build black-box elevators.  They’ve
got to be inspectable.  And they have to be repairable by the
people in whose buildings they are.  That’s a sensible rule,
arrived at over a long period of experience with what can happen
when things fall.  Which you would expect us to carry unchanged
into our experience of the digital environment, but which is not.</p>
<p>The basic principle of the difficulty that we face is we can’t see
enough and we can’t modify it fast enough to ... [assess] what
went wrong after it fails.  What we actually need is the ability
to harness civil society to prevent failure.</p>
<p>This is a problem which can be prevented more easily than it can
be coped with after the fact.</p>

<p>You give away the <em>infinite</em> goods, not the <em>scarce</em> goods.  Your

don’t earn any kind of royalties for the software they write.

<p>My view is it’s just the unrolling of a thing that came from very
far, long ago.  It’s a reversal of a local eddy in the current of
time.  Microsoft made it appear that software was a product, for a
little while.  But knowledge is rarely a product, and the
technological information about the terms on which we and the
digital brains exist [i.e. software], that’s not a product.
That’s a culture.  That’s the record of a deposit of human beings
and the “other” in conversation.  It’s like literature: it can’t
be a product.  So what we are discovering is it’s a culture made
by communities.  And we could have known that in 1965 or 1970.  It
was hard to see in 1990.  But it’s easy to see again in 2006.  In
my judgement, this is in that historical sense more about clearing
away a temporary confusion than it is about some strange and
amazing departure that suddenly occurred.</p>

<p>I think the roots of this antagonism to science run very deep.
They’re ancient.  We see them in Genesis, this first story, this
founding myth of ours, in which the first humans are doomed and
cursed eternally for asking a question, for partaking of the fruit
of the Tree of Knowledge.  It’s puzzling that Eden is synonymous
with paradise when, if you think about it at all, it’s more like a
maximum-security prison with twenty-four hour surveillance.  It’s
a horrible place.  Adam and Eve have no childhood.  They awaken
full-grown.  What is a human being without a childhood?  Our long
childhood is a critical feature of our species.  It differentiates
us, to a degree, from most other species.  We take a longer time
to mature.  We depend upon these formative years and the social
fabric to learn many of the things we need to know.</p>

<p>When my husband [Carl Sagan] died, because he was so famous and

end and converted to a belief in an afterlife.  They also
frequently ask me if I think I will see him again.  Carl faced his
death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in
illusions.  The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each
other again.  I don’t ever expect to be reunited with Carl.</p>

elegant”?  Instead they say, “No, no, no!  My god is a little god,
and I want him to stay that way.”  A religion, old or new, that

science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe
hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me explain why, when it comes to children, I think of religion
as a dangerous virus.  It’s a virus which is transmitted partly
through teachers and clergy, but also down the generations from
parent to child to grandchild.  Children are especially vulnerable
to infection by the virus of religion.</p>
<p>A child is genetically pre-programmed to accumulate knowledge from
figures of authority.  The child brain, for very good Darwinian
reasons, has to be set up in such a way that it believes what it’s
told by its elders, because there just isn’t time for the child to
experiment with warnings like “Don’t go too near the cliff edge!”
or “Don’t swim in the river, there are crocodiles!”  Any child who
applied a scientific sceptical questioning attitude to that, would
be dead.</p>
<p>No wonder the Jesuits said, “Give me the child for his first seven
years and I’ll give you the man.”</p>
<p>The child brain will automatically believe what it’s told even if
what it’s told is nonsense.  And then when the child grows up it
will tend to pass on that same nonsense to its children.</p>
<p>And so religion goes on from generation to generation.</p>
<p>For many people, part of growing up is killing off the virus of
faith with a good strong dose of rational thinking.  But if an
individual doesn’t succeed in shaking it off, his mind is stuck in
a permanent state of infancy.  And there is a real danger that he
will infect the next generation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... the brain is responsible for consciousness.  And we can be
reasonably sure that when that brain ceases to be, when it falls
apart and decomposes, that will be the end of us.  From that quite
a lot of things follow, especially morally.  We are the very
privileged owners of a brief spark of consciousness.  And we
therefore have to take responsibility for it.  We cannot rely, as
Christians or Muslims do, on a world elsewhere, a paradise, to
which one can work towards and maybe make sacrifices, and,
crucially, make sacrifices of other people.  We have a marvelous
gift.  When you see it develop in children, this ability to become
aware that other people have minds just like your own and feelings
that are just as important as your own, and this gift of empathy
seems to me to be the building block of our moral system.</p>

<p>And if you have a sacred text that tells you how the world began
or what the relationship is between this sky-god and you, it does
curtail your curiosity, it cuts off a source of wonder.  The

<p>I spent the evening visiting my old friend EKH, who is pretty much
your average Enlightenment philosopher’s ideal of a good human

two perfect kids.  He makes a living doing really arcane things
that I do not even begin to understand in Python.  He is the most
brilliant person I have ever met in terms of sheer brute abstract
reasoning power.  He plays Go at a near-professional level, and is
fluent in Japanese.  And he can build houses.  You want to be him.
Trust me.  Or at least have him for a friend.</p>

<p>I feel obligated to correct certain errors in the above:</p>

reasonable, and neither am I.</li>
<li>My children are not perfect, but they’re good kids, <a class="reference external" href="beliefs.html#parenting">raised well

<li>I like to think that I’m intelligent, but I don’t know how
“brilliant” I am.  I can only assume that Fearsclave has not met so
many people with “sheer brute abstract reasoning power”.</li>
<li>I play go at about a 1-dan or 2-dan amateur level, hardly
near-professional.</li>
<li>My Japanese is conversational, but has plenty of holes.  My
vocabulary, for example, sucks.</li>
<li>I have <em>helped</em> my father (who <em>can</em> build houses) to build
<em>additions</em> to houses, and am handy around my own house.</li>
<li>You don’t want to be me, believe me.  I have plenty of problems of

<p><cite>The God Delusion</cite> is a powerful book which contains a lot of truth.
Humanists, naturalists, <a class="reference external" href="http://the-brights.net/">brights</a>,
freethinkers, “atheists”, and agnostics will find it a very
interesting and worthy read.  People “of faith” may find it a
challenge though—a challenge to their faith.  In fact, I challenge any
person of faith to read <cite>The God Delusion</cite> with an open mind and to
try to refute its arguments.  If their faith is entirely unaffected,
they must be deluding themselves.</p>

special section for it.  Below, other people quoted in <cite>The God
Delusion</cite> are identified by name and page number.  Direct quotes of

<p>Why is God considered an explanation for anything?  It’s not -
it’s a failure to explain, a shrug of the shoulders, an ‘I dunno’

something to God, generally what it means is that they haven’t a
clue, so they’re attributing it to an unreachable, unknowable
sky-fairy.  Ask for an explanation of where that bloke came from,
and odds are you’ll get a vague, pseudo-philosophical reply about
having always existed, or being outside nature.  Which, of course,
explains nothing.</p>

<p>More generally (and this applies to Christianity no less than to

<p>Children, I’ll argue, have a human right not to have their minds
crippled by exposure to other people’s bad ideas — no matter who
these other people are.  Parents, correspondingly, have no
God-given licence to enculturate their children in whatever ways
they personally choose: no right to limit the horizons of their
children’s knowledge, to bring them up in an atmosphere of dogma
and superstition, or to insist they follow the straight and narrow
paths of their own faith.</p>
<p>In short, children have a right not to have their minds addled by
nonsense, and we as a society have a duty to protect them from it.
So we should no more allow parents to teach their children to
believe, for example, in the literal truth of the Bible or that
the planets rule their lives, than we should allow parents to
knock their children’s teeth out or lock them in a dungeon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thank my own parents for taking the view that children should be
taught not so much <em>what</em> to think as <em>how</em> to think.  If, having
been fairly and properly exposed to all the scientific evidence,
they grow up and decide that the Bible is literally true or that
the movements of the planets rule their lives, that is their
privilege.  The important point is that it is <em>their</em> privilege to
decide what they shall think, and not their parents’ privilege to
impose it by <em>force majeure</em>.  And this, of course, is especially
important when we reflect that children become the parents of the
next generation, in a position to pass on whatever indoctrination
may have moulded them.</p>

thought and love lose their value because they are not
everlasting.  Many a man has borne himself proudly on the
scaffold; surely the same pride should teach us to think truly
about man’s place in the world.  Even if the open windows of
science at first make us shiver after the cosy indoor warmth of
traditional humanizing myths, in the end the fresh air brings
vigour, and the great spaces have a splendour of their own.</p>

runs the risk of being prosecuted for murder.  When I am dying, I
should like my life to be taken out under a general anaesthetic,
exactly as if it were a diseased appendix.  But I shall not be
allowed that privilege, because I have the ill-luck to be born a

<p>Religions are often the state-protected nurseries of pseudoscience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science is far from a perfect instrument of knowledge.  It is just
the best we have.  In this respect, as in many others, it’s like
democracy.  Science by itself cannot advocate courses of human
action, but it can certainly illuminate the possible consequences
of alternative courses of action.</p>
<p>The scientific way of thinking is at once imaginative and
disciplined.  This is central to its success.  Science invites us
to let the facts in, even when they don’t conform to our
preconceptions.  It counsels us to carry alternative hypotheses in
our heads and see which best fits the facts.  It urges on us a
delicate balance between no-holds-barred openness to new ideas,
however heretical, and the most rigorous skeptical scrutiny of
everything—new ideas and established wisdom.  This kind of
thinking is also an essential tool for a democracy in an age of
change.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for its success is that science has built-in,
error-correcting machinery at its very heart.  Some may consider
this an overbroad characterization, but to me every time we
exercise self-criticism, every time we test our ideas against the
outside world, we are doing science.  When we are self-indulgent
and uncritical, when we confuse hopes and facts, we slide into
pseudoscience and superstition.</p>
<p>Every time a scientific paper presents a bit of data, it’s
accompanied by an error-bar—a quiet but insistent reminder that
no knowledge is complete or perfect.  It’s a calibration of how
much we trust what we think we know.  If the error bars are small,
the accuracy of our empirical knowledge is high; if the error bars
are large, then so is the uncertainty in our knowledge.  Except in
pure mathematics, nothing is known for certain (although much is
certainly false).</p>
<p>Moreover, scientists are usually careful to characterize the
veridical status of their attempts to understand the
world—ranging from conjectures and hypotheses, which aer highly
tentative, all the way up to laws of Nature which are repeatedly
and systematically confirmed through many interrogations of how
the world works.  But even laws of Nature are not absolutely
certain.  There may be new circumstances never before
examined—inside black holes, say, or within the electron, or
close to the speed of light—where even our vaunted laws of
Nature break down and, however valid they may be in ordinary
circumstances, need correction.</p>
<p>Humans may crave absolute certainty; they may aspire to it; they
may pretend, as partisans of certain religions do, to have
attained it.  But the history of science—by far the most
successful claim to knowledge accessible to humans—teaches that
the most we can hope for is successive improvement in our
understanding, learning from our mistakes, an asymptotic approach
to the Universe, but with the proviso that absolute certainty will
always elude us.</p>

<p>Science, Ann Druyan notes, is forever whispering in our ears,
“Remember, you’re very new at this.  You might be mistaken.
You’ve been wrong before.”  Despite all the talk of humility, show
me something comparable in religion.  Scripture is said to be
divinely inspired—a phrase with many meanings.  But what if it’s
simply made up by fallible humans?  Miracles are attested, but
what if they’re instead some mix of charlatanry, unfamiliar states
of consciousness, misapprehensions of natural phenomena, and
mental illness?  No contemporary religion and no New Age belief
seems to me to take sufficient account of the grandeur,
magnificence, subtlety and intricacy of the Universe revealed by
science.  The fact that so little of the findings of modern
science is prefigured in Scripture to my mind casts further doubt
on its divine inspiration.</p>

<p>I’m frequently asked, “Do you believe there’s extraterrestrial
intelligence?”  I give the standard arguments—there are a lot of
places out there, the molecules of life are everywhere, I use the
word <em>billions</em>, and so on.  Then I say it would be astonishing to
me if there weren’t extraterrestrial intelligence, but of course
there is as yet no compelling evidence for it.</p>
<p>Often, I’m asked next, “What do you really think?”</p>
<p>I say, “I just told you what I really think.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but what’s your gut feeling?”</p>
<p>But I try not to think with my gut.  If I’m serious about
understanding the world, thinking with anything besides my brain,
as tempting as that might be, is likely to get me into trouble.
Really, it’s okay to reserve judgment until the evidence is in.</p>

<p>Those who invalidate reason ought seriously to consider whether
they argue against reason with or without reason; if with reason,

rational conviction, nor do they deserve a rational argument.</p>
