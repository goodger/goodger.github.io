Japan is a wonderful country: exotic yet safe & clean, with friendly
people, gorgeous views, and delicious food.
The myriad differences from Western societies make Japan an essential
travel destination, but they also make it a challenging place to
visit.

Here are some quick tips to make your visit a success and as
stress-free as possible.


Planning Your Trip
==================

* I recommend you plan to stay AT LEAST 2 weeks in Japan, preferably 3
  weeks or more.
  It takes 3 to 7 days just to get over the jet lag!

* The flight to Japan is long and draining.
  The last thing you want is more travel right away.
  It takes about an hour to get from the airport to Tōkyō Station by
  train (plus the time to get to your hotel).
  It’s another 1½ to 2 hours to get to Saku from Tōkyō by *shinkansen*
  (bullet train).

  If flying into and/or out of Narita Airport, I recommend staying in
  `Narita City`_ for your first and/or last days & nights, either in
  town near the train stations (recommended) or near the airport.

  Another option (depending on the airline) is to use Haneda Airport,
  which is much closer to central Tōkyō.

* To a Westerner, many things in Japan are new, strange, and
  fascinating.
  You will be functionally illiterate, so be patient and allow plenty
  of time to get around and figure things out.
  You will feel overwhelmed and exhausted every day, so don’t pack too
  much in; leave some down time for rest every day, and even build in
  some rest days.

* You’ll probably want to visit some major destinations_.
  Consider alternating busy city visits with quiet time surrounded by
  mountains.
  You may have other destinations in mind depending on your specific
  interests.

* Spring & autumn are the best times to visit.
  Cherry blossoms in spring!
  Abundant fruits in fall!

  Avoid visiting during the summer.
  It gets hot & humid in June, when rainy season starts.
  July & August are terrible.
  September is still hot, but not too bad.

  Avoid visiting around New Year’s, during “Golden Week” (April 29
  through May 5), or (less so) during “Obon__” (August 13-16): these
  are long holidays when *everybody* in Japan travels and all modes of
  transportation are crowded (reserved seats are recommended).
  Tōkyō tends to empty out during these times though.

  __ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obon

* Japanese hotel rooms tend to be quite small.
  Larger North-American-sized rooms are rare and quite expensive.

  * If there’s no bedside table, park your suitcase against the wall
    beside your bed and use that.

  * If there’s no electrical outlet where you need one, ask for an
    extension cord (*enchō-kōdo*) at the front desk.

  * I recommend the `Toyoko Inn`__ chain of hotels.
    They’re reasonably priced, very clean, and include breakfast.
    Their beds are very firm.
    If you stay more than 3 nights, it’s worthwhile to become a
    `Toyoko Inn Club`__ member: 5% off, earlier check-in, 1 free
    single-bed room coupon per 10 nights stayed, museum & golf
    discounts, etc.

    __ https://www.toyoko-inn.com/

  Many Japanese hotels have coin-operated washing machines & dryers.

* Don’t bother renting a car.
  Driving on the left takes getting used to, as do Japan’s narrow
  streets (some incredibly narrow).
  Use public transportation, which is excellent and ubiquitous.
  Fall back on taxis when necessary.

* The sun can be intense.
  Bring sunscreen, wear a hat, or buy a sun parasol.

* ⇒ [To do] Get the travel app to easily pay for train rides: Suica
  card or Pasmo.

  ⇒ Google Wallet (see video)

* Plan to chill out on the weekends and on public holidays, when
  attractions, restaurants, and malls are always busy.
  Schedule visits on non-holiday weekdays.

* Asakusa in Tōkyō (a tourist street leading to large temple) has all
  the souvenirs you could ever want, but it is overcrowded during the
  day, especially on weekends and holidays.
  Visit at night for a much more intimate experience, but the shops
  will be closed.
  Better yet, visit Naritasan Shinshō-ji (temple) and Naritasan park
  instead (see `Narita City`_).

* Convert prices easily: for a first approximation, just treat yen as
  cents.
  Imagine a decimal place two digits in from the right, so ¥25,000 is
  approximately $250 Canadian.

* Sales tax is 10% (8% for essentials).
  Purchases are tax-free for visitors with your passport at some
  stores.


Preparations for Your Trip
==========================

* As with any tourism, plan on doing a lot of walking.
  If you’re not used to walking a lot, do some training before your
  trip.
  Work your way up to at least an hour of walking per day.

* Invest in some quality compression stockings.
  One pair for the very long flight, and an extra pair or two for
  travel & walking days.

* Get good travel health insurance.

* If you are taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter,
  prepare enough to last your entire trip, and maybe a bit more.
  The legal limit is a 1- or 2-month supply, depending on the type.
  Bring the medications in their original pharmacy packaging with
  prescriptions.
  Officially, “when you bring your personal medicines into Japan, you
  have to apply for so called ‘Yunyu Kakunin-sho’, a kind of import
  certificate, and receive it before you leave home, and declare it to
  the officer at customs”.

  Japan is very strict about drugs, and often the customs people will
  err on the side of caution.

  See `Information for those who are bringing medicines for personal
  use into Japan`__.

  __ https://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/01.html

* Get some Japanese yen cash.
  Many/most places now take credit cards but smaller places still only
  take cash.

  Japan’s bills are ¥1000 (about $10), ¥5000, and ¥10,000 (about
  $100).

* Inform your credit card company that you’ll be travelling, when &
  where, to prevent your credit transactions being denied.

* Install a translation app on your phone, like `Google Translate`_
  (`Android app`__, `iPhone app`__), and get the Japanese language
  pack for it.

  .. _Google Translate: https://translate.google.com/
  __ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&hl=en
  __ https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506

* Get a visitor’s mobile data plan, with or without a calling plan.
  Mobile data access is essential while you’re here, for `Google
  Translate`_, maps, etc.
  We have used Mobal__ in the past (includes a calling plan with a
  phone number), but there are many__ others__.
  Make sure your phone is compatible with the service, especially if
  it’s older (mine was compatible with Mobal in March 2024, but not in
  August!).

  eSIM plans like Saily__ and `Journey Japan eSIM`__ provide data
  only, but you don’t get voice calling service (i.e. no real phone
  number).
  Maybe you don’t *need* a real phone number though.
  You can easily exchange voice calls with family & friends using
  WhatsApp etc.
  To make calls to regular landlines & mobile phones using your
  data-only plan you’ll need `an app/service with a nominal fee`__;
  `Viber Out`__ is a reasonable app & service.

* Japan is truly a land of cute and cool stuff.
  You may experience cuteness/coolness overload.
  Make sure you leave plenty of space in your luggage for souvenirs!

* Speaking of luggage, regular economy flights to Japan usually offer
  one free checked bag per person.
  Here’s an airline hack to get an extra checked bag for free if your
  airline offers free advance check-in of your carry-on bag:

  At online check-in the day before your flight, when presented with
  the option for free check-in of your carry-on bag, accept it.
  When it’s time to check your luggage, hand over your extra
  full-sized bag instead of your carry-on.
  Bring your carry-on to the gate as normal.
  This works because after the system is told you have an extra
  checked bag, nobody verifies its size, nor do they make sure you
  don’t still have a carry-on bag.

  [**NOTE**: This worked for us in August 2024 with Air Canada, but it
  may or may not work for you.]


Know Before You Go
==================

* Although they are thankfully becoming more rare, you may encounter a
  squat toilet in a time of need.
  Be prepared: learn how to use them in advance (article__, video__).

  __ https://bigtinyworld.com/japanese-squat-toilets/
  __ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCTKDn3Q8xQ

* At the other end of the spectrum are the high-tech “washlets”: bidet
  seats on Western-style toilets.
  Here’s `How To Use Japanese Toilets`__ (video).

  __ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRAHxvLu9es

* Travelling by train is very convenient... IF you aren’t carrying a
  lot of luggage.
  If you have large suitcases, it can be a royal pain.
  There’s a lot of walking and staircases, and major stations are
  usually crowded.
  Most stations have escalators or elevators, but not all.
  Most trains don’t have places to put large suitcases (Narita Express
  does).

  Also, many cars (including ours) are small, only fitting 4 adults
  comfortably and they can’t fit much in the trunk.
  Taxis tend to have large trunks though.

  But this is Japan, so of course there is a solution!
  Japan’s `home delivery service`__ (“*takkyūbin*”) is cheap (~$25)
  and reliable. At the airport or at your hotel you can drop off your
  suitcases for next-day (sometimes same-day) delivery to your
  destination.
  Just keep your carry-on and your personal item with you, and pack
  (or re-pack) accordingly.
  The delivery services also offer a luggage storage service at the
  airport, so you can ship your luggage a day or two before heading
  home and pick it up when you arrive at the airport.

  __ https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2278.html

  At both Narita & Hanéda airports you’ll find some combination of
  Yamato_ (black cat logo), Sagawa_, and `JAL ABC`_ counters.

  .. _Yamato: https://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/
  .. _`JAL ABC`: https://www.jalabc.com/en/hands-freetravel.html
  .. _Sagawa: https://www.sagawa-exp.co.jp/ttk/english/

* When paying at a store or restaurant, place your cash on the small
  tray near the cash register, with bills face up.
  Do not hand cash directly to the cashier.
  They may return your change via the same tray or directly.

* When paying with a credit card (say “*kādo dé*” = “with a card”),
  you may be asked “*ikkai*?” = “one time?”.
  Just reply “*hai*” = “yes”.
  There’s an installment system built into credit card payment systems
  here (with fees of course).

* People may want to speak to you in English, on the train, on the
  street, in an *onsen*, etc.
  Most people in Japan have had at least 6 years of English classes
  (up to 12 years for younger people), and while most are shy and lack
  confidence, some will want to practise.
  Try to speak clearly and simply, and have patience.
  You may get the same questions over and over: “Where are you from?”,
  “How long are you in Japan?”, “What do you like to eat?”, etc.


Bring (or buy when you get here)
================================

* If you’re going to be visiting anyone, bring *omiyagé*: small gifts
  from your home country.
  Japan is a gift-exchange culture, and this will be appreciated.
  For example, when visiting from Canada we would often bring maple
  syrup and maple-flavored items (cookies, candies, etc.).
  Reusable shopping bags are another good option.
  Handicrafts are a great option, because they won’t be available
  locally!

* Always have a handkerchief to dry your hands.
  Paper towels are often absent in washrooms.
  Sometimes there will be air dryers, but don’t count on it.

* Always have tissues, because they can be hard to find when you need
  them (e.g. when you need to wipe yourself at a squat toilet).
  They’re also useful for drying your hands.
  However, don’t be surprised if you’re handed a packet of tissues
  (with advertising) outside of a busy train station.

* You’re going to do a lot of walking, so bring some good walking
  shoes.

* Bring shoes that are easy to take off and put on again, because you
  will be removing your shoes a lot!
  Slip-on shoes are best. Consider elastic shoelaces like “Lock Laces”
  or “Xpand”.

* Bring a water bottle, or better yet, buy one here.
  They have great “*mahōbin*” (“majic bottles”: double-walled
  vacuum-insulated bottles) here, in many sizes, colors, and styles.

* Have a coin pouch or a dedicated coin pocket in your wallet, because
  you will accumulate and carry many coins.
  The largest yen coin is ¥500, about $5.
  Other coins are ¥1, ¥5, ¥10, ¥50, and ¥100.

* Be prepared to carry any trash you create.
  For example, wrappers when you buy food at a convenience store or at
  a food stand.
  If you eat the food away from the source, there may not be a place
  to put the wrappers.
  Trash bins are few & far between.
  Have a bag for this purpose (e.g. accept the ¥3 plastic bag when you
  buy something).

* Pack some Pepto-Bismol (tablets are best), because you may catch a
  Japanese virus (or a foreign virus, on the plane) that you have no
  immunity against.
  Japan’s water & food are very clean, but you never know.

* Bring an umbrella, because it can rain a lot here.
  Or buy one of those cool semi-disposable clear plastic umbrellas
  here.
  When it starts raining, half the shops will suddenly start selling
  umbrellas.

* Bring a good eye mask: contoured, not just flat.
  Depending on where you’re coming from, Japan’s time zone is up to 12
  hours difference; literally night and day.
  For the first several days (up to a week!) you will be adjusting to
  the new time zone and a good eye mask can help you sleep when you
  need to, especially early in the morning in summer (no daylight
  saving time, so the sun comes up early!).

* I pack a small travel power bar with 2 AC outlets & 2 USB outlets.
  Combined with a 2-prong-to-3-slot adapter, this covers most of my
  travel electrical needs.
  `This one`__ doesn’t need an adapter.

  __ https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B096YC9LY2/

  * Mains electricity in Japan is 100 volts, either 50 Hz or 60 Hz
    depending on where in the country (50 Hz in Tōkyō & Gunma &
    further east, 60 Hz in most of Nagano [including Saku] & further
    west).
    Most laptop power supplies, USB adapters, and battery chargers can
    handle Japan’s electricity regardless.
    Don’t bother with a voltage adapter.
    High-current devices (e.g. hair dryers) may not work properly
    here, so don’t bring any.

  * Most `Japanese electrical sockets`__ are similar to sockets in
    North America but lack a 3rd ground slot/hole (i.e. Type A NEMA 1
    ungrounded).
    The two slots are the same length in older sockets, both short
    (i.e. unpolarized).
    If you’re bringing any devices with 3-prong or 2-prong polarized
    plugs, bring an adapter or buy one here: 2-prong unpolarized (both
    prongs short) male to 3-slot polarized (short & long slots) female
    socket adapter, like `these ones`__.

    __ https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09CPXW8R5/

    Japanese search term: 接地 アダプター.

  * There are electronics stores like Yamada Denki and K’s Denki, and
    home centers like Cainz, Viva Home, and D2, in or near every city.
    Daiso and Seria (Japan’s dollar store chains) carry cheap USB
    cables (and LOTS of other stuff).
    Convenience stores carry an amazing range of useful items, but may
    not have the specific thing you’re looking for.
    There’s also amazon.co.jp.

* If you can’t handle chopsticks, there are assistant devices
  available.

• Have a secure passport holder; by law you must carry your passport
  with you at all times.
  Theft and pickpocketing is rare in Japan but it does happen
  sometimes, such as in tourist areas and other crowded places.


Do’s & Don’ts
=============

Strong Do’s:

* Do try sushi and sashimi *without* any soy sauce.
  I find that soy sauce drowns out the subtle natural flavours of
  foods.
  Also, eating sushi/sashimi without soy sauce is a great compliment
  to the chef.

* Do try unknown foods that may *seem* nasty or *sound* funny but are
  actually nice.
  You’d be surprised at how delicious many of them are.
  Foods like *nori* (seaweed sheets), *unagi* (grilled eel), and *ika*
  (squid) are excellent, not to mention sushi & sashimi.
  Drinks like Pocari Sweat and Calpis are worth a try!

* Do try weird Japanese foods that often don’t appeal to Western
  palettes, but you may like some.
  From worst to least bad: *nattō* (fermented soybeans), *uméboshi*
  (pickled plum), *goya* (bitter gourd/melon/squash), dried squid or
  squid jerky, *kon’nyaku* (konjak jelly), fishy snacks, *wagashi*
  (Japanese sweets), *manjū* (small buns filled with sweet bean
  paste), etc.

* Do remove your shoes at level differences (esp. house entryways) and
  put on slippers (usually provided, although small).

  Socks or bare feet on tatami (remove your slippers!).

* Do try to pronounce Japanese words correctly.
  It isn’t difficult, `it just requires remembering a few simple
  rules`__.

  __ pronunciation.html

* Do be aware of the direction of traffic: cars drive on the left.
  Be very careful when crossing the street, as this may catch you
  unaware!
  Always look both ways, twice, before crossing.

* Do carry your passport with you at all times.
  This is required by law.
  You could be asked to show it at any time by police, and if you
  don’t have it you will face delays at best and you could be arrested
  at worst.
  Also, your passport is needed to check in to hotels, and it could
  save you money on purchases (no sales tax at some stores).

  Keep physical copies of your passport and credit cards and IDs
  separately (e.g. photocopies in your luggage) and digital copies on
  your phone.

Strong Don’ts:

* Japan is very strict about drugs and other illicit materials, so DO
  NOT bring anything illegal.

* Don’t wear cologne or perfume.
  A little light deodorant is fine.

* Don’t tip.
  There’s no tipping in Japan!
  If you do leave a tip, a staff member is likely to run after you to
  return your cash.

* Chopsticks taboos:

  * Never stick your chopsticks into your food and leave them there,
    especially not vertically.

  * Never pass anything from your chopsticks to someone else’s.
    Instead, place it on their plate.

  These are only done at funerals or with an offering to the dead.

Weak don’ts below.
I do these all the time.

* Don’t walk & eat.
  At least, Japanese people tend not to do this (but there are
  exceptions).
  Even with street food, they’ll stand and eat it near where they
  bought it.
  For one thing, there tend not to be any trash bins except where the
  food was sold, and putting unrelated trash in another shop’s bin is
  frowned upon.

If you don’t know what to do in a situation, just smile and bow and it
will usually turn out okay.

Being quite homogenous, Japan is a racist country, but foreigners
(especially Western caucasians) are usually treated well, as “exalted
guests”.
If you commit a faux-pas, you’ll often be given a pass because of your
origin.
This is sometimes referred to as “playing the *gaijin* card”.
When done deliberately, it’s “the *gaijin* smash”.

Restaurants
===========

* The food is typically excellent: delicious and beautifully presented.

  `Anthony Bourdain on Japan’s food.`__

  __ https://www.instagram.com/p/DADQHyHNU3X/

* As long as you avoid the overpriced restaurants in international
  hotels and high-end places, meals are cheap here!

* No tipping!

* Many restaurants are open for lunch (e.g. 11:00-14:00) & dinner
  (17:00-21:00) and are closed in between while they prepare for the
  next meal.
  Common signage:

  * Open: 「営業中」
  * Closed, in preparation: 「準備中」
  * Closed for the day: 「本日は終了」 (「本日」 means “today”)
  * Closed today (day off): 「休業日」, 「定休日」

* Many restaurants have display windows full of realistic fake
  versions of their menu items.
  Menus often feature photos as well.
  If not, in the worst case, you could take a picture of what you want
  to order or bring the server to the display window and point out
  what you want.

* Occasionally a restaurant will refuse entry to foreigners; “no
  foreigners” or “Japanese only” signs even exist.
  This usually isn’t overt racism, but simply because they don’t have
  an English menu and their staff don’t speak English.
  If you have someone in your group who speaks Japanese they can
  reassure the staff, who should then be fine serving your group.

* At lunch time the staff will present the lunch menu and specials.
  However, there is often a “Grand Menu” with more options that can be
  ordered from at any time.

* Usually substitutions aren’t possible, especially at chain
  restaurants.

* Water comes in very small glasses.
  If you’re lucky, the restaurant may leave a carafe of water for
  refills, or there may be a self-serve water & tea station.
  Otherwise you’ll have to ask for more water.

* Some restaurants offer self-serve tea at the table: green tea powder
  with a hot water spigot.

  If the tea is too hot, get some ice water and add ice to your tea.


* Many restaurants feature ordering from a tablet or from your own
  mobile phone via a QR code.
  There is often an English interface, but not always.

* Many restaurants offer normal & large sizes (“*ōmori*” or “W” =
  “double”) for when you’re really hungry and want a big meal.
  On the other hand, conveyor-belt sushi places often offer half
  portions of rice (“*hanshari*”) for when you want more of the good
  stuff and less of the bulk.

* Speaking of rice, the Japanese love it, but they usually eat it
  plain.
  This can be boring to visitors (and foreign residents) who don’t
  appreciate the subtleties.
  Often an alternative is offered, sometimes at a higher price: garlic
  rice, multigrain rice, fried rice (“*chāhan*”), etc.
  Same for soup: plain miso vs loaded soup.

* Meals don’t arrive together.
  They arrive when they’re ready.

* Beware some people’s (typically men’s) noisy eating habits.

* Slurping hot noodles is fine and expected.
  Not spaghetti though.

* Many restaurants provide “*oshibori*”: wet towels used to wipe your
  hands before your meal.
  Men often wipe their face as well, although this is bad manners.
  In lower-end restaurants, *oshibori* are just wet wipes in plastic
  wrappers.
  In higher-end restaurants, *oshibori* are clean heated face towels.

* Most restaurants provide a “*denpyō*”, a sales slip that at least
  identifies your table and may list your complete order.
  It’s a slip of paper sometimes rolled up and inserted in a small
  acrylic tube, sometimes on a small clipboard.
  Take this to the cash at the end of the meal to pay.

* Some restaurants feature ticket machines at the entrance, where
  you’ll select and pay for your meal in advance.
  You then give the provided tickets to the wait staff and they’ll
  bring the food.

* At many fast food restaurants, rather than making you wait at the
  counter for your food, you will be provided with a numbered sign for
  your table and your food will be delivered when it’s ready.


Ideas For Dining Out
--------------------

* Ichō is a chain of tradional-style Japanese family restaurants where
  each party has a small private room (not soundproof though; expect
  to hear children’s voices).
  Their menu features a wide variety, the food is good and
  surprisingly inexpensive.
  We often go there when we want to meet someone and talk for several
  hours, which is not a problem as long as you don’t stay through both
  lunch & dinner.
  Or if you do, be sure to order dinner as well.

* Yuméan and Ootoya are also tradional Japanese family
  restaurants, with booths instead of private rooms.

* Conveyor belt sushi: Kura Sushi, Kappa Sushi, Sushiro, etc.
  You can pick up plates from the “local” conveyor (Kura Sushi only),
  or order à-la-carte and your plates will arrive via the express
  lane.
  Lots of variety, and not just sushi: fried chicken, *tempura*,
  *donburi* (rice bowls), etc.

  Kappa Sushi has slightly better food than Kura Sushi, but Kura Sushi
  has a better overall experience.

* Rāmen is a good option for tasty noodles in the soup of your choice:
  *miso*, soy/*shōyū*, salt/*shio*; my favorite is pork/*tonkotsu* but
  it’s not as common.
  The noodles often come with slices of roast pork (*chāshū*) and egg.
  Get a side of *gyōza* potstickers, *chāhan* fried rice, and/or
  *kara-agé* fried chicken.
  There are many chains and a plethora of local shops.

* Family restaurants like Royal Host (at the high end), Steak-no-Don,
  Denny’s, Coco’s, Gusto (at the low end), and many others abound.
  At the lower end, expect part of your meal to be delivered by robot!

* *Donburi* restaurants like Sukiya, Yoshinoya, and Matsuya.
  A *donburi* is a bowl of rice topped with beef, chicken, pork,
  *tempura*, or vegetables.

* Marugamé Seimen for *udon* (thick noodles).

* Dessert: Fujiya for cakes, hard & soft-serve ice cream, etc. (with
  seating; some Fujiya locations are also family restaurants, but not
  in the one in Saku); Châteraisé (takeout) for cakes & ice cream.

* Bakeries feature a wide variety of savoury & sweet pastries &
  breads.
  Worth visiting.

* High-end (= expensive) sushi and other restaurants also exist.

* *Yaki-niku* = Korean barbecue, where you grill meat at your table.
  For example, Chōsen-hanten.

* Street food like *tai-yaki*, *tako-yaki*, and festival food like
  choco-banana etc.

* Fast food: Mos Burger

And of course, we can also `dine in`__.

Destinations
============

`In & Near Saku`__

__ staying-with-us.html#destinations


General
-------

* Visit a castle.

* Visit an *onsen* hot spring bath.
  See `How to Use a Japanese Bath`_.

* Visit a Shintō shrine and a Buddhist temple.
  They’re everywhere in Japan.

  “Buddhism emphasizes the idea of transcending the cosmos, which it
  regards as being replete with suffering, while Shinto focuses on
  adapting to life’s pragmatic requirements.” [Wikipedia]

  From `10 Differences Between Shinto and Buddhism`__:

      __ https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/10-differences-between-shinto-and-buddhism

      Shintō is an animistic religion: its practitioners believe that
      every living thing—and even inanimate objects like rocks—is
      animate and possesses a spirit, called *kami*.
      Buddhism isn’t a theistic religion at all.
      Humans who have achieved enlightenment, like the Buddha himself,
      are venerated.

      Buddhists believe in a cycle of death and rebirth that continues
      until a person achieves an enlightened state.
      Shinto tradition holds that after death a person’s kami passes
      on to another world and watches over their descendants.
      This is why ancestor worship is still an important part of
      modern-day Japanese culture.

  Shrines always have one or more *torii* gates at their entrance, two
  horizontal beams supported by two vertical pillars, often
  red-painted wood but sometimes grey concrete (⛩).
  Names of shrines end in *jinja*, *jingu*, or *taisha*.

  Buddhist temples usually have a large roofed gate that looks more
  like a large house.
  Names of temples end with *ji*, *in*, *tera*, or *dera*.

Top Destinations
----------------

There are a myriad places to visit in Japan, and only a few are listed
here with scant details.
The reader is encouraged to do their own research.


Tokyo
`````

Properly pronounced “Tōkyō” (long “o”s), the capital of Japan was
formerly called “Édo”.
Tōkyō is not merely a city but a prefecture (like a province or
state), containing 23 central “wards” many of which are themseves
large cities, multiple outlying cities, towns, villages, and even
countryside and mountains!
More people live within commuting distance of Tōkyō than in all of
Canada.

There are lots of travel books about Tōkyō.
Here are some that are different:

* `Tokyo Geek’s Guide: Manga, Anime, Gaming, Cosplay, Toys, Idols &
  More - The Ultimate Guide to Japan’s Otaku Culture`

* `Lonely Planet Kids City Trails - Tokyo`

* `Cool Tokyo Guide: Adventures in the City of Kawaii Fashion, Train
  Sushi and Godzilla`


Kyoto
`````

“Kyōto” (first “o” is long) was the capital of Japan from 794 CE to
1869 CE, when the capital was moved to Tōkyō (formerly “Édo”).
Kyōto is full of history, although it is also a modern city.
Near Ōsaka, Nara, and Kōbé.


Osaka
`````

“Ōsaka” (long “o”) has a culture of its own, more flashy than most of
Japan.
Near Kyōto, Nara, and Kōbé.


Nara
````

Nara was the capital of Japan before it moved to Kyoto.
Nara is the site of Tōdai-ji (Buddhist temple) which houses the
world’s largest bronze statue of the Buddha, which is located in Nara
Park, which features free-roaming sika deer.
Near Kyōto, Ōsaka, and Kōbé.


Hiroshima
`````````

Hiroshima is a city in the west of Japan’s main island, Honshū.
Hiroshima was the first military target of a nuclear weapon in
history, on August 6, 1945, and is the site of The Hiroshima Peace
Memorial.


Nagasaki
````````

Nagasaki is a city on the southwestern island of Kyūshū.
Nagasaki was sole port used for trade with the Portuguese and Dutch
during the 16th through 19th centuries, when the rest of Japan was
closed to the outside world.
Nagasaki was the second city in the world to experience a nuclear
attack, on August 9, 1945.


Mount Fuji
``````````

I recommend viewing Mount Fuji from a bullet train or from nearby, but
climbing it is not worth the time & effort.


Nikkō
`````

Nikkō is a beautiful town in the mountains north of Tōkyō, about 2½
hours by train.
Nikkō Tōshō-gū is the shrine with the “three monkeys”: “see no evil,
hear no evil, speak no evil”.


Narita City
```````````

Narita City is like a mini Kyōto with a large temple (Naritasan
Shinshō-ji), a large adjacent park, and a tourist street (Naritasan
Omotésandō) where you can marvel at all things traditional Japanese,
with shops, restaurants, street food, and activities.

If you’re flying into or out of Narita Airport, the nearby Narita City
is a great first and/or last place to visit.
At the beginning of your stay in Japan, decompress from your long
flight with a relaxing stay at a hotel and enjoy the tourist-oriented
town.
At the end of your stay in Japan, stay at a hotel, enjoy the day in
the town, pick up any last-minute souvenirs, then head to the airport
without worrying about getting there on time.
Use your hotel’s shuttle service if available and convenient, or take
a taxi or a local train.
In addition to the Omotésandō tourist/shopping street, there’s a small
Aeon Town mall in town and a large Aeon Mall a short bus ride away,
plus lots of shopping at the airport.

Mayumi and I stayed in Narita City for the first time in March 2024
and again in August 2024, and it was great.
We have stayed at the following hotels, but there are many other
options:

* Hedistar Hotel Narita: very small rooms, but cheap & clean.
  It’s 1.0 km (about 13 minutes walking) to & from the train stations
  and the start of Naritasan Omotésandō (the tourist street), or 700 m
  (9 minutes walking) to the main gate of Naritasan Shinshō-ji temple
  via the less-interesting back roads.

* APA Hotel Keisei-Narita Station: more expensive, nicer rooms,
  features *onsen* baths.
  It’s very close to the train stations and the start of Naritasan
  Omotésandō.

* Toyoko Inn Narita Airport: good value, breakfast included.
  It’s near the airport and not the city so you have to take the hotel
  shuttle to the airport and then take the train into town (about an
  hour total), or take a much more expensive taxi.

Airport hotels are convenient to the airport, but not much else.
Apart from convenience stores (“konbini”) and a few restaurants,
there’s nothing nearby.
Hotels in Narita City proper have the advantage of location: there’s
lots to see and do just by stepping outside and walking around.
You can go out in the evening on the day you arrive, and in the
morning on the day you leave.

It’s a 20-minute local train ride (cost ¥200–¥300) from the airport to
Narita Station.
It’s about an hour by from the airport to Tōkyō, and another 90
minutes by *shinkansen* (bullet train) from Tōkyō to Saku.

Hokkaido
````````

Hokkaidō (long last “o”) is the northernmost major island and
prefecture of Japan, and is the homeland of the Ainu indigenous
people.


Ghibli Museum & Ghibli Park
```````````````````````````

If you’re into the Ghibli films, these are prime destinations.
Tickets are limited though and must be booked months in advance; they
sell out quickly.
We haven’t been yet.

`Ghibli Museum`__ is in western Tōkyō.

`Ghibli Park`__ is a theme park near Nagoya.

Shimanami Kaido
```````````````

The `Shimanami Kaido`__ (`official site`__) is a 70 km (minimum)
cycling route joining the mainland (Honshū) from Hiroshima Prefecture
with six islands in Japan’s Inland Sea, ending at the island of
Shikoku (video__).
We haven’t been yet, but we’re keen to go!

Shopping
========

* Supermarkets.
  Play the “What’s this?” game!
  If you see something you think you might like, try it!

* Convenience stores in Japan are wonderful.

* Don Quixoté (AKA “Don-ki”) is kind of like the Walmart of Japan, but
  a visit is an assault on your senses.

* Daiso & Seria & Watts: ¥100 shops.
  Surprisingly high quality goods compared to typical dollar stores.

* Modern shopping centers to see how they differ from those in North
  America.

* Old-style shopping arcades (“Ginza”), often a downtown street
  covered with a roof.

* *Gatchapon* capsule stores & game centers.

* Second-hand stores, especially if you’re into any Japanese media.

* Muji store: clothes and storage and foods.

* *Dagashi-ya*: retro candy & sundry stores that are often decorated
  to look like they’re from the *Shōwa* era.


Souvenirs
=========

Here are some ideas:

* *Yukata* are unlined cotton summer robes, traditionally white & blue
  but available in all sorts of colors & patterns.
  Much less expensive and more practical than traditional *kimono*, they
  make great bathrobes!
  *Yukata* literally translates to “bathing cloth”.

* *Furoshiki*: These large square cloths are used to bundle up any
  number of things: a *bentō* meal, a couple bottles, fruit, your
  clothes, books, etc.
  `There are many ways of tying furoshiki`__; it’s like a combination
  of *origami* and knot tying.

  __ https://www.env.go.jp/en/focus/attach/060403-5.html

* *Origami*: Beautiful paper squares for folding into myriad shapes,
  from the practical to the fantastical.
  *Washi* (traditional Japanese paper) is tougher than ordinary paper
  and has a great texture.

* Chopsticks (*hashi*) and chopstick rests (*hashi-oki*) can be
  beautiful and tiny souvenirs.
  Many stores carry chopsticks and rests as everyday necessities, but
  there are specialty shops that have hundreds of designs, real works
  of art.
  There’s one such specialty shop on the Omotésandō street in `Narita
  City`_.

* Spend some time at a big *gatchapon* capsule store, where there’s a
  huge variety of cute & interesting & useful & useless categories of
  items available.
  They’re small and often delightful.
  You may find something that perfectly encapsulates your experience
  of Japan!
