Japan is a wonderful country: exotic yet safe & clean, with friendly
people, gorgeous views, and delicious food. The myriad differences
from Western societies make Japan an essential travel destination, but
they also make it a challenging place to visit.

Here are some quick tips to make your visit a success and as
stress-free as possible.


Planning Your Trip
==================

* I recommend you plan to stay AT LEAST 2 weeks in Japan, preferably 3
  weeks or more. It takes 3 to 7 days just to get over the jet lag!

* To a Westerner, many things in Japan are new, strange, and
  fascinating. You will be functionally illiterate, so be patient and
  allow plenty of time to get around and figure things out. You will
  feel overwhelmed and exhausted every day, so don‚Äôt pack too much in;
  leave some down time for rest every day, and even build in some rest
  days.

* You‚Äôll probably want to visit some major destinations_. Consider
  alternating busy city visits with quiet time surrounded by
  mountains. You may have other destinations in mind depending on your
  specific interests.

* Spring & autumn are the best times to visit. Cherry blossoms in
  spring!

  Avoid visiting during the summer. It gets hot & humid in June,
  when rainy season starts. July & August are terrible. September is
  still hot, but not too terrible.

  Avoid visiting around New Year‚Äôs, during ‚ÄúGolden Week‚Äù (April 29
  through May 5), or (less so) during ‚ÄúObon__‚Äù (August 13-16): these
  are long holidays when *everybody* in Japan travels and all modes of
  transportation are crowded. Tokyo tends to empty out during these
  times though.

  __ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obon

* Japanese hotel rooms tend to be quite small. Larger
  North-American-sized rooms are rare and quite expensive.

  * If there‚Äôs no bedside table, park your suitcase against the wall
    beside your bed and use that.

  * If there‚Äôs no electrical outlet where you need one, ask for an
    extension cord (*ench≈ç-k≈çdo*) at the front desk.

  * I recommend the `Toyoko Inn`__ chain of hotels. They‚Äôre reasonably
    priced, very clean, and include breakfast. Their beds are very
    firm though. If you stay more than 3 nights, it‚Äôs worthwhile to
    become a `Toyoko Inn Club`__ member: 5% off, earlier check-in, 1
    free single-bed room coupon per 10 nights stayed, museum & golf
    discounts, etc.

    __ https://www.toyoko-inn.com/
    __ https://www.toyoko-inn.com/club/?lcl_id=en

  Many Japanese hotels have coin-operated washing machines & dryers.

* If flying into and/or out of Narita Airport, I recommend staying in
  `Narita City`_ for your first and/or last days & nights, either in
  town near the train stations or near the airport.

* The other option is to use Haneda Airport, which is much closer to
  central Tokyo.

* Don‚Äôt bother renting a car. Driving on the left takes getting used
  to, as do Japan‚Äôs narrow streets (some incredibly narrow). Use
  public transportation, which is excellent and ubiquitous. Fall back
  on taxis when necessary.

* The sun can be intense. Bring sunscreen, wear a hat, or buy a sun
  parasol.

* ‚áí Get the travel app to easily pay for train rides: Suica card or
  Pasmo.

  ‚áí Google Wallet (see video)

* Plan to chill out on the weekends and on public holidays, when
  attractions, restaurants, and malls are always busy. Schedule visits
  on non-holiday weekdays.

* Asakusa in Tokyo is overcrowded during the day, especially on
  weekends. Visit at night for a much more intimate experience, but
  the shops will be closed. Better yet, visit Naritasan Shinsh≈ç-ji
  (temple) and Naritasan park instead (see `Narita City`_).

* Convert prices easily: for a first approximation, just treat yen as
  cents. Imagine a decimal place two digits in from the right, so
  ¬•25,000 is approximately $250.

* Sales tax is 10% (8% for essentials). Purchases are tax-free for
  visitors with your passport at some stores.


Preparations for Your Trip
==========================

* As with any tourism, plan on doing a lot of walking. If you‚Äôre not
  used to walking a lot, do some training before your trip. Work your
  way up to at least an hour of walking per day.

* Invest in a good set of compression stockings. One pair for the very
  long flight, and an extra pair or two for travel & walking days.

* Get good travel health insurance.

* If you are taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter,
  prepare enough to last your entire trip, and maybe a bit more. The
  legal limit is a 1- or 2-month supply, depending on the type. Bring
  the medications in their original pharmacy packaging with
  prescriptions. Officially, ‚Äúwhen you bring your personal medicines
  into Japan, you have to apply for so called ‚ÄòYunyu Kakunin-sho‚Äô, a
  kind of import certificate, and receive it before you leave home,
  and declare it to the officer at customs‚Äù. Japan is very strict
  about drugs, and often the customs people will err on the side of
  caution. See `Information for those who are bringing medicines for
  personal use into Japan`__.

* Get some Japanese yen cash. Many/most places now take credit cards
  but smaller places still only take cash.

  Japan‚Äôs bills are ¬•1000 (about $10), ¬•5000, and ¬•10,000 (about
  $100).

* Inform your credit card company that you‚Äôll be travelling, when &
  where, to prevent your credit transactions being denied.

* Install a translation app on your phone, like `Google Translate`_
  (`Android app`__, `iPhone app`__), and get the Japanese language
  pack for it.

  .. _Google Translate: https://translate.google.com/
  __ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&hl=en
  __ https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506

* Get a visitor‚Äôs mobile data plan, with or without a calling plan.
  Mobile data access is essential while you‚Äôre here, for `Google
  Translate`_, maps, etc. We have used Mobal__ in the past, but there
  are many__ others__. Make sure your phone is compatible with the
  service, especially if it‚Äôs older (mine was compatible with Mobal in
  March 2024, but not in August!).

  eSIM plans like Saily__ and `Journey Japan eSIM`__ provide data
  only, but you don‚Äôt get voice calling service (i.e. no real phone
  number). Maybe you don‚Äôt *need* a real phone number though. You can
  easily exchange voice calls with family & friends using WhatsApp
  etc. To make calls to regular landlines & mobile phones using your
  data-only plan you‚Äôll need `an app/service with a nominal fee`__;
  `Viber Out`__ seems to be a reasonable app & service.

* Japan is truly a land of cute and cool stuff. You may experience
  cuteness/coolness overload. Make sure you leave plenty of space in
  your luggage for souvenirs!

* Speaking of luggage, regular economy flights to Japan usually offer
  one free checked bag per person. Here‚Äôs an airline hack to get an
  extra checked bag for free if your airline offers free advance
  check-in of your carry-on bag:

  At online check-in the day before your flight, when presented with
  the option for free check-in of your carry-on bag, accept it. When
  it‚Äôs time to check your luggage, hand over your extra full-sized bag
  instead of your carry-on. Bring your carry-on to the gate as normal.
  This works because after the system is told you have an extra
  checked bag, nobody verifies its size, nor do they make sure you
  don‚Äôt still have a carry-on bag.

  [**NOTE**: This worked for us in August 2024 with Air Canada, but it
  may or may not work for you.]


Know Before You Go
==================

* Although they are thankfully becoming more rare, you may encounter a
  squat toilet in a time of need. Be prepared: learn how to use them
  in advance (article__, video__).

  __ https://bigtinyworld.com/japanese-squat-toilets/
  __ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCTKDn3Q8xQ

* At the other end of the spectrum are the high-tech ‚Äúwashlets‚Äù: bidet
  seats on Western-style toilets. Here‚Äôs `How To Use Japanese
  Toilets`__ (video).

  __ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRAHxvLu9es

* Travelling by train is very convenient... IF you aren‚Äôt carrying a
  lot of luggage. If you have large suitcases, it can be a royal pain.
  There‚Äôs a lot of walking and staircases, and major stations are
  usually crowded. Most stations have escalators or elevators, but not
  all. Most trains don‚Äôt have places to put large suitcases. Also, our
  car is small; it only fits 4 adults comfortably and can‚Äôt fit much
  in the trunk.

  But this is Japan, so of course there is a solution! Japan‚Äôs `home
  delivery service`__ (‚Äú*takky≈´bin*‚Äù) is cheap (~$25) and reliable. At
  the airport or at your hotel you can drop off your suitcases for
  next-day (sometimes same-day) delivery to your destination. Just
  keep your carry-on and your personal item with you, and pack
  accordingly. The delivery services also offer a luggage storage
  service, so you can ship your luggage a day or two before heading
  home and pick it up at the airport.

  __ https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2278.html

  At both Narita & Han√©da airports you‚Äôll find some combination of
  Yamato_ (black cat logo), Sagawa_, and `JAL ABC`_ counters.

  .. _Yamato: https://www.global-yamato.com/en/hands-free-travel/
  .. _`JAL ABC`: https://www.jalabc.com/en/hands-freetravel.html
  .. _Sagawa: https://www.sagawa-exp.co.jp/ttk/english/

* When paying at a store or restaurant, place your cash on the small
  tray near the cash register, with bill face up. Do not hand cash
  directly to the cashier.

* When paying with a credit card, you may be asked ‚Äú*ikkai*?‚Äù = ‚Äúone
  time?‚Äù. Just reply ‚Äú*hai*‚Äù = ‚Äúyes‚Äù. There‚Äôs an installment system
  built into credit card payment systems here (with fees of course).

* People may want to speak to you in English, on the train, on the
  street, in an *onsen*, etc. Most people in Japan have had at least 6
  years of English classes (up to 12 years for younger people), and
  while most are shy and lack confidence, some will want to practise.
  Try to speak clearly and simply, and have patience. You‚Äôll get the
  same questions over and over: ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow long are
  you in Japan?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat do you like to eat?‚Äù, etc.


Bring (or buy when you get here)
================================

* If you‚Äôre going to be visiting anyone, bring *omiyag√©*: small gifts
  from your home country. Japan is a gift-exchange culture, and this
  will be appreciated. For example, when visiting from Canada we would
  often bring maple syrup and maple-flavored items (cookies, candies,
  etc.). Reusable shopping bags are another good option.

* Always have a handkerchief to dry your hands. Paper towels are often
  absent in washrooms. Sometimes there will be air dryers, but don‚Äôt
  count on it.

* Always have tissues, because they can be hard to find when you need
  them (e.g. when you need to wipe yourself at a squat toilet).
  They‚Äôre also useful for drying your hands. However, don‚Äôt be
  surprised if you‚Äôre handed a packet of tissues (with advertising)
  outside of a busy train station.

* You‚Äôre going to do a lot of walking, so bring some good walking
  shoes.

* Bring shoes that are easy to take off and put on again, because you
  will be removing your shoes a lot! Slip-on shoes are best. Consider
  elastic shoelaces like ‚ÄúLock Laces‚Äù or ‚ÄúXpand‚Äù.

* Have a coin pouch or a dedicated coin pocket in your wallet, because
  you will accumulate and carry many coins. The largest yen coin is
  ¬•500, about $5. Other coins are ¬•1, ¬•5, ¬•10, ¬•50, and ¬•100.

* Be prepared to carry any trash you create. For example, wrappers
  when you buy food at a convenience store or at a food stand. If you
  eat the food away from the source, there may not be a place to put
  the wrappers. Trash bins are few & far between. Have a bag for this
  purpose (e.g. accept the ¬•3 plastic bag when you buy something).

* Pack some Pepto-Bismol (tablets are best), because you may catch a
  Japanese virus (or a foreign virus, on the plane) that you have no
  immunity against. Japan‚Äôs water & food are very clean, but you never
  know.

* Bring an umbrella, because it can rain a lot here. Or buy one of
  those cool semi-disposable clear plastic umbrellas here. When it
  starts raining, half the shops will suddenly start selling
  umbrellas.

* Bring a good eye mask: contoured, not just flat. Depending on where
  you‚Äôre coming from, Japan‚Äôs time zone is up to 12 hours difference;
  literally night and day. For the first several days (up to a week!)
  you will be adjusting to the new time zone and a good eye mask can
  help you sleep when you need to, especially early in the morning in
  summer (no daylight saving time, so the sun comes up early!).

* I pack a small travel power bar with 2 AC outlets & 2 USB outlets.
  Combined with a 2-prong-to-3-slot adapter, this covers most of my
  travel electrical needs. `This one`__ doesn‚Äôt need an adapter.

  __ https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B096YC9LY2/

  * Mains electricity in Japan is 100 volts, either 50 Hz or 60 Hz
    depending on where in the country (50 Hz in T≈çky≈ç & Gunma &
    further east, 60 Hz in most of Nagano [including Saku] & further
    west). Most laptop power supplies, USB adapters, and battery
    chargers can handle Japan‚Äôs electricity regardless. Don‚Äôt bother
    with a voltage adapter. High-current devices (e.g. hair dryers)
    may not work properly here, so don‚Äôt bring any.

  * Most `Japanese electrical sockets`__ are similar to sockets in
    North America but lack a 3rd ground slot/hole (i.e. Type A NEMA 1
    ungrounded). The two slots are the same length in older sockets,
    both short (i.e. unpolarized). If you‚Äôre bringing any 3-prong
    devices, bring a 2-prong unpolarized (both prongs short) male to
    3-slot polarized (short & long slots) female socket adapter, like
    `these ones`__. If you‚Äôre bringing any devices with 3-prong or
    2-prong polarized plugs, bring an adapter or buy one here.

    __ https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09CPXW8R5/

    Japanese search term: Êé•Âú∞ „Ç¢„ÉÄ„Éó„Çø„Éº.

  * There are electronics stores like Yamada Denki and home centers
    like Cainz, Viva Home, and D2 in or near every city. Daiso
    (Japan‚Äôs dollar store chain) carries cheap USB cables (and LOTS of
    other stuff). Convenience stores carry an amazing range of useful
    items, but may not have the specific thing you‚Äôre looking for.
    There‚Äôs also amazon.co.jp.

* If you can‚Äôt handle chopsticks, there are assistant devices
  available.


Do‚Äôs & Don‚Äôts
=============

Strong Do‚Äôs:

* Do try sushi and sashimi *without* any soy sauce. I find that soy
  sauce drowns out the subtle natural flavours of foods. Also, eating
  sushi/sashimi without soy sauce is a great compliment to the chef.

* Do try unknown foods that may *seem* nasty or *sound* funny but are
  actually nice. You‚Äôd be surprised at how delicious many of them are.
  Foods like *nori* (seaweed sheets), *unagi* (grilled eel), and *ika*
  (squid) are excellent, not to mention sushi & sashimi. Drinks like
  Pocari Sweat and Calpis are worth a try!

* Do try weird Japanese foods that often don‚Äôt appeal to Western
  palettes, but you may like some. From worst to least bad: *natt≈ç*
  (fermented soybeans), *um√©boshi* (pickled plum), *goya* (bitter
  gourd/melon/squash), dried squid or squid jerky, *kon‚Äônyaku* (konjak
  jelly), fishy snacks, *wagashi* (Japanese sweets), *manj≈´* (small
  bun filled with sweet bean paste), etc.

* Do remove your shoes at level differences (esp. house entryways) and
  put on slippers (usually provided, although small).

  Socks or bare feet on tatami (remove your slippers!).

* Do try to pronounce Japanese words correctly. It isn‚Äôt difficult,
  `it just requires remembering a few simple rules`__.

  __ pronunciation.html

Strong Don‚Äôts:

* Japan is very strict about drugs and other illicit materials, so DO
  NOT bring anything illegal.

* Don‚Äôt wear cologne or perfume. A little light deodorant is fine.

* Don‚Äôt tip. There‚Äôs no tipping in Japan! If you do leave a tip, a
  staff member is likely to run after you in the street to return your
  cash.

* Chopsticks taboos:

  * Never stick your chopsticks into your food and leave them there,
    especially not vertically.

  * Never pass anything from your chopsticks to someone else‚Äôs.
    Instead, place it on their plate.

  These are only done at funerals or with an offering to the dead.

Weak don‚Äôts below. I do these all the time.

* Don‚Äôt walk & eat. At least, Japanese people tend not to do this (but
  there are exceptions). Even with street food, they‚Äôll stand and eat
  it near where they bought it. For one thing, there tend not to be a
  trash bins except where the food was sold, and putting unrelated
  trash in another shop‚Äôs bin is frowned upon.

If you don‚Äôt know what to do in a situation, just smile and bow and it
will usually turn out okay.

Being quite homogenous, Japan is a racist country, but foreigners
(especially Western caucasians) are usually treated well, as ‚Äúexalted
guests‚Äù. If you commit a faux-pas, you‚Äôll often be given a pass
because of your origin. This is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúplaying the
*gaijin* card‚Äù.

Restaurants
===========

* The food is typically excellent: delicious and beautifully presented.

  `Anthony Bourdain on Japan‚Äôs food.`__

  __ https://www.instagram.com/p/DADQHyHNU3X/

* As long as you avoid the overpriced restaurants in international
  hotels and high-end places, meals are cheap here!

* No tipping!

* Many restaurants are open for lunch (e.g. 11:00-14:00) & dinner
  (17:00-21:00) and are closed in between while they prepare for the
  next meal. Common signage:

  * Open: „ÄåÂñ∂Ê•≠‰∏≠„Äç
  * Closed, in preparation: „ÄåÊ∫ñÂÇô‰∏≠„Äç
  * Closed for the day: „ÄåÊú¨Êó•„ÅØÁµÇ‰∫Ü„Äç („ÄåÊú¨Êó•„Äç means ‚Äútoday‚Äù)
  * Closed today (day off): „Äå‰ºëÊ•≠Êó•„Äç, „ÄåÂÆö‰ºëÊó•„Äç

* Many restaurants have display windows full of realistic fake
  versions of their menu items. Menus often feature photos as well. If
  not, in the worst case, you could take a picture of what you want to
  order or bring the server to the display window and point out what
  you want.

* Occasionally a restaurant will refuse entry to foreigners; ‚Äúno
  foreigners‚Äù or ‚ÄúJapanese only‚Äù signs even exist. This usually isn‚Äôt
  overt racism, but simply because they don‚Äôt have an English menu and
  their staff don‚Äôt speak English. If you have someone in your group
  who speaks Japanese they can reassure the staff, who should then be
  fine serving your group.

* At lunch time the staff will present the lunch menu and specials.
  However, there is often a ‚ÄúGrand Menu‚Äù with more options that can be
  ordered from at any time.

* Usually substitutions aren‚Äôt possible, especially at chain
  restaurants.

* Water comes in very small glasses. If you‚Äôre lucky, the restaurant
  may leave a carafe of water for refills, or there may be a
  self-serve water & tea station. Otherwise you‚Äôll have to ask for
  more water.

* Some restaurants offer self-serve tea at the table: green tea powder
  with a hot water spigot.

  If the tea is too hot, get some ice water and add ice to your tea. 

* Many restaurants feature ordering from a tablet or from your own
  mobile phone via a QR code. There is often an English interface, but
  not always.

* Many restaurants offer normal & large sizes (‚Äú*≈çmori*‚Äù or ‚ÄúW‚Äù =
  ‚Äúdouble‚Äù) for when you‚Äôre really hungry and want a big meal. On the
  other hand, conveyor-belt sushi places often offer half portions of
  rice (‚Äú*hanshari*‚Äù) for when you want more of the good stuff and
  less of the bulk.

* Speaking of rice, the Japanese love it, but they usually eat it
  plain. This can be boring to visitors (and foreign residents) who
  don‚Äôt appreciate the subtleties. Often an alternative is offered,
  sometimes at a higher price: garlic rice, multigrain rice, fried
  rice (‚Äú*chƒÅhan*‚Äù), etc. Same for soup: plain miso vs loaded soup.

* Meals don‚Äôt arrive together. They arrive when they‚Äôre ready.

* Beware some people‚Äôs (typically men‚Äôs) noisy eating habits.

* Slurping hot noodles is fine and expected. Not spaghetti though.

* Many restaurants provide ‚Äú*oshibori*‚Äù: wet towels used to wipe your
  hands before your meal. Men often wipe their face as well, although
  this is bad manners. In lower-end restaurants, *oshibori* are just
  wet wipes in plastic wrappers. In higher-end restaurants, *oshibori*
  are heated towels.

* Most restaurants provide a ‚Äú*denpy≈ç*‚Äù, a sales slip that at least
  identifies your table and may list your complete order. It‚Äôs a slip
  of paper sometimes rolled up and inserted in a small acrylic tube,
  sometimes on a small clipboard. Take this to the cash at the end of
  the meal to pay.

* Some restaurants feature ticket machines at the entrance, where
  you‚Äôll select and pay for your meal in advance. You then give the
  provided tickets to the wait staff and they‚Äôll bring the food.

* At many fast food restaurants, rather than making you wait at the
  counter for your food, you will be provided with a numbered sign for
  your table and your food will be delivered when it‚Äôs ready.


Ideas For Dining Out
--------------------

* Ich≈ç is a chain of tradional-style Japanese family restaurants where
  each party has a small private room (not soundproof though; expect
  to hear children‚Äôs voices). Their menu features a wide variety, the
  food is good and surprisingly inexpensive. We often go there when we
  want to meet someone and talk for several hours, which is not a
  problem as long as you don‚Äôt stay through both lunch & dinner. Or if
  you do, be sure to order dinner as well.

* Yum√©an and Ootoya are also tradional Japanese family
  restaurants, with booths instead of private rooms.

* Conveyor belt sushi: Kura Sushi, Kappa Sushi, Sushiro, etc. You can
  pick up plates from the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù conveyor (Kura Sushi only), or order
  √†-la-carte and your plates will arrive via the express lane. Lots of
  variety, and not just sushi: fried chicken, *tempura*, *donburi*
  (rice bowls), etc.

  Kappa Sushi has slightly better food than Kura Sushi, but Kura Sushi
  has a better overall experience.

* RƒÅmen is a good option for tasty noodles in the soup of your choice:
  *miso*, soy/*sh≈çy≈´*, salt/*shio*; my favorite is pork/*tonkotsu* but
  it‚Äôs not so common. The noodles often come with slices of roast
  pork (*chƒÅsh≈´*) and egg. Get a side of *gy≈çza* potstickers and/or
  *chƒÅhan* fried rice. There are many chains and a plethora of local
  shops.

* Family restaurants like Royal Host (at the high end), Steak-no-Don,
  Denny‚Äôs, Coco‚Äôs, Gusto (at the low end), and many others abound. At
  the lower end, expect part of your meal to be delivered by robot!

* *Donburi* restaurants like Sukiya, Yoshinoya, and Matsuya. A
  *donburi* is a bowl of rice topped with beef, chicken, pork,
  *tempura*, or vegetables.

* Marugam√© Seimen for *udon* (thick noodles).

* Dessert: Fujiya for cakes, hard & soft-serve ice cream, etc. (with
  seating; some Fujiya locations are also family restaurants, but not
  in the one in Saku); Ch√¢terais√© (takeout) for cakes & ice cream. In
  Saku: Chatamaya (takeout) for cream puffs & the scenery on the way;
  Tamaya for local delicacies; etc.

* Bakeries feature a wide variety of savoury & sweet pastries &
  breads. Worth visiting.

* High-end (= expensive) sushi and other restaurants also exist.

* *Yaki-niku* = Korean barbecue. For example, Ch≈çsen-hanten.

* Street food like *tai-yaki*, *tako-yaki*, and festival food like
  choco-banana etc.

* Fast food: Mos Burger

And of course, we can also `dine in`__.

Destinations

`In & Near Saku`__

__ staying-with-us.html#destinations


General
-------

* Visit a castle.

* Visit an *onsen* hot spring bath. See `How to Use a Japanese Bath`_.

* Visit a Shint≈ç shrine and a Buddhist temple. They‚Äôre everywhere in
  Japan.

  ‚ÄúBuddhism emphasizes the idea of transcending the cosmos, which it
  regards as being replete with suffering, while Shinto focuses on
  adapting to life‚Äôs pragmatic requirements.‚Äù [Wikipedia]

  From `10 Differences Between Shinto and Buddhism`__:

      __ https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/10-differences-between-shinto-and-buddhism

      Shint≈ç is an animistic religion: its practitioners believe that
      every living thing‚Äîand even inanimate objects like rocks‚Äîis
      animate and possesses a spirit, called *kami*. Buddhism isn‚Äôt a
      theistic religion at all. Humans who have achieved
      enlightenment, like the Buddha himself, are venerated.

      Buddhists believe in a cycle of death and rebirth that continues
      until a person achieves an enlightened state. Shinto tradition
      holds that after death a person‚Äôs kami passes on to another
      world and watches over their descendants. This is why ancestor
      worship is still an important part of modern-day Japanese
      culture.

  Shrines always have one or more *torii* gates at their entrance, two
  horizontal beams supported by two vertical pillars, often
  red-painted wood but sometimes grey concrete. Names of shrines end

  Buddhist temples usually have a large roofed gate that looks more
  like a large house. Names of temples end with *ji*, *in*, *tera*, or
  *dera*.

Top Destinations
----------------

There are a myriad places to visit in Japan, and only a few are listed
here with scant details. The reader is encouraged to do their own
research.


Tokyo
`````

Properly pronounced ‚ÄúT≈çky≈ç‚Äù (long ‚Äúo‚Äùs), the capital of Japan was
formerly called ‚Äú√âdo‚Äù. Tokyo is not a city but a prefecture,
containing 23 ‚Äúwards‚Äù and multiple cities, towns, villages, and even
countryside! More people live within commuting distance of Tokyo than
in all of Canada.

There are lots of travel books about Tokyo. Here are some that are
different:

* `Tokyo Geek‚Äôs Guide: Manga, Anime, Gaming, Cosplay, Toys, Idols &
  More - The Ultimate Guide to Japan‚Äôs Otaku Culture`

* `Lonely Planet Kids City Trails - Tokyo`

* `Cool Tokyo Guide: Adventures in the City of Kawaii Fashion, Train
  Sushi and Godzilla`


Kyoto
`````

‚ÄúKy≈çto‚Äù (first ‚Äúo‚Äù is long) was the capital of Japan from 794 CE to
1869 CE, when the capital was moved to Tokyo (formerly ‚Äú√âdo‚Äù). Kyoto
is full of history, although it is also a modern city. Near Osaka,
Nara, and K≈çb√©.


Osaka
`````

‚Äú≈åsaka‚Äù (long ‚Äúo‚Äù) has a culture of its own, more flashy than most of
Japan. Near Kyoto, Nara, and K≈çb√©.


Nara
````

Nara was the capital of Japan before it moved to Kyoto. Nara is the
site of T≈çdai-ji (Buddhist temple) which houses the world‚Äôs largest
bronze statue of the Buddha, which is located in Nara Park, which
features free-roaming sika deer. Near Kyoto, Osaka, and K≈çb√©.


Hiroshima
`````````

Hiroshima is a city in the west of Japan‚Äôs main island, Honsh≈´.
Hiroshima was the first military target of a nuclear weapon in
history, on August 6, 1945, and is the site of The Hiroshima Peace
Memorial.


Nagasaki
````````

Nagasaki is a city on the southwestern island of Ky≈´sh≈´. Nagasaki was
sole port used for trade with the Portuguese and Dutch during the 16th
through 19th centuries, when the rest of Japan was closed to the
outside world. Nagasaki was the second city in the world to experience
a nuclear attack, on August 9, 1945.


Mount Fuji
``````````

I recommend viewing Mount Fuji from a bullet train or from nearby, but
climbing it is not worth the time & effort.


Nikk≈ç
`````

Nikk≈ç is a beautiful town in the mountains north of Tokyo, about 2¬Ω
hours by train. Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ is the shrine with the ‚Äúthree monkeys‚Äù:
‚Äúsee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil‚Äù.


Narita City
```````````

Narita City is like a mini Ky≈çto with a large temple (Naritasan
Shinsh≈ç-ji), a large adjacent park, and a tourist street (Naritasan
Omot√©sand≈ç) where you can marvel at all things traditional Japanese,
with shops, restaurants, street food, and activities.

If you‚Äôre flying into or out of Narita Airport, the nearby Narita City
is a great first and/or last place to visit. At the beginning of your
stay in Japan, decompress from your long flight with a relaxing stay
at a hotel and enjoy the tourist-oriented town. At the end of your
stay in Japan, stay at a hotel, enjoy the day in the town, pick up any
last-minute souvenirs, then head to the airport without worrying about
getting there on time. Use your hotel‚Äôs shuttle service if available
and convenient, or take a taxi or a local train. In addition to the
Omot√©sand≈ç tourist/shopping street, there‚Äôs a small Aeon Town mall in
town and a large Aeon Mall a short bus ride away, plus lots of
shopping at the airport.

Mayumi and I stayed in Narita City for the first time in March 2024
and again in August 2024, and it was great. We have stayed at the
Hedistar Hotel Narita (very small rooms, but cheap & clean), APA Hotel
Keisei-Narita Station (more expensive, nicer rooms, features *onsen*
baths), and Toyoko Inn Narita Airport (good value, but near the
airport and not the city so you have to take their shuttle to the
airport and then take the train into town, or a more expensive taxi).
There are many other options.

Hokkaido
````````

Hokkaid≈ç (long last ‚Äúo‚Äù) is the northernmost major island and
prefecture of Japan, and is the homeland of the Ainu indigenous
people.


Ghibli Museum & Ghibli Park
```````````````````````````

If you‚Äôre into the Ghibli films, these are prime destinations. Tickets
are limited though and must be booked months in advance; they sell out
quickly. We haven‚Äôt been yet.

`Ghibli Museum`__ is in western Tokyo.

`Ghibli Park`__ is a theme park near Nagoya.

Shimanami Kaido
```````````````

The `Shimanami Kaido`__ (`official site`__) is a 70 km (minimum)
cycling route joining the mainland (Honsh≈´) from Hiroshima Prefecture
with six islands in Japan‚Äôs Inland Sea, ending at the island of
Shikoku (video__). We haven‚Äôt been yet, but we‚Äôre keen to go!

Shopping
========

* Supermarkets. Play the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù game! If you see something you
  think you might like, try it!

* Convenience stores in Japan are wonderful.

* Don Quixot√© (AKA ‚ÄúDon-ki‚Äù) is kind of like the Walmart of Japan, but
  a visit is an assault on your senses.

* Daiso & Seria: ¬•100 shops. Surprisingly high quality goods compared
  to typical dollar stores.

* Modern shopping centers to see how they differ from those in North
  America.

* Old-style shopping arcades (‚ÄúGinza‚Äù), often a downtown street
  covered with a roof.

* *Gatchapon* capsule stores & game centers.

* Second-hand stores, especially if you‚Äôre into any Japanese media.

* Muji store: clothes and storage and foods.

* *Dagashi-ya*: retro candy & sundry stores that are often decorated
  to look like they‚Äôre from the *Sh≈çwa* era.
