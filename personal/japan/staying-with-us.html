<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-1">Saku, Nagano</a></h1>
<p>We chose to live in Saku because of its relatively cool (or at least
bearable) summers due to its location in the mountains (elevation 760
m ≈ 2500 ft). In exchange, we experience cold winters. Because ours is
an old house, when it’s cold outside it’s cold inside as well.</p>
<p>Saku is a city of approximately 100,000 residents spread out over 423
km² in the eastern part of central Nagano Prefecture. Saku was formed
by the agglomeration of multiple towns (Iwamurada, Nakagomi, Nozawa,
Usuda, Mochizuki, Asashina, Asama) which remain distinct neighborhoods
with their own downtowns. Much of Saku remains agricultural. Our house
is in a residential neighborhood in the northeast part of Saku with
shopping nearby, but farm fields, woods, and the Yu River are only a
few minutes walk away.</p>
<p>Saku contains the point furthest from the sea within Honshū island and
is surrounded by mountains: the Asama Range to the north, Mount Hirao
to the east, and Mount Tatéshina &amp; the Yatsugatake Mountain Range to
the south. Saku has relatively little precipitation and many sunny
days thanks to these mountains. Saku has hot and humid summers and
relatively mild winters. Mount Asama is a volcano, mildly active for
now; the last major eruption was over 200 years ago.</p>
<p>In 1997 the Hokuriku Shinkansen bullet train line (formerly the Nagano
Shinkansen) opened with Sakudaira station in Saku. From Sakudaira
Station it takes 70-85 minutes to Tokyo Station (some trains skip
smaller stations). Many people now commute to Tokyo by bullet train.
Saku is also connected to surrounding areas by local trains. The area
around Sakudaira station has become the downtown area of greater Saku,
with a shopping center, large stores, many restaurants, and a
community park.</p>
<p>Immediately to the east of Saku is Gunma Prefecture. To the north are
the towns of Komoro (population 42,000), Miyota (15,000), and
Karuizawa (a famous resort town where wealthy people have summer
homes; population 20,000). To the west is the town of Tateshina
(7100). Further to the west of Saku are the cities of Ueda (157,000),
Nagano (the capital of Nagano Prefecture; population 365,000), and
Matsumoto (239,000).</p>

<div class="section" id="our-home">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2">Our Home</a></h1>
<p>As a guest in our home you will experience staying in a real
late-<em>Shōwa</em>-era Japanese house, built in 1977. The experience will be
similar to staying at a <em>minshuku</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Minshuku</em> are a low-budget version of <em>ryokan</em>, roughly
equivalent to a British boarding house or a bed and breakfast. The
facilities... may simply consist of spare rooms in a family home.
<em>Minshuku</em> often serve as the only type of accommodation in towns
or villages too small to warrant a dedicated hotel or <em>ryokan</em>.
The overall experience is much the same, but the food is simpler,
dining may be optional and is often communal, rooms don’t usually
have a private toilet, and guests may have to lay out their own
bedding.</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan#Minshuku">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Ours is a big house for two people by Japanese standards, but modest
by Canadian standards: 177 m² (≈ 1900 sq.ft) including storage spaces,
hallways, and even the thickness of the walls. Like most houses in
Japan, there’s no basement. When we bought the house in 2024 it had
been empty for 5 years, one of Japan’s many <em>akiya</em> (empty houses).
When it was built our house replaced a much older and larger house
(“<em>minka</em>”). The family who used to live here were coincidentally also
named Takahashi (it’s the third most common family name in Japan) and
many relatives live in the area, some nearby. The Takahashi family
were local farmers, and many farming tools and supplies came with the
house.</p>
<p>Our property’s land area is 530 m² ≈ 5700 sq.ft., mostly filled by the
house and 4 outbuildings: a 2-car garage, a 2-storey grain storehouse,
a small shed in front of the house, and a large shed in the back. We
plan to remove the large shed in the back, freeing up space for a yard
or for a vegetable garden, and the small shed in the front, freeing up
space for a deck or for a small yard or for a traditional Japanese
decorative garden. There’s a small empty property to the east (211 m²
≈ 2270 sq.ft), and other <em>akiya</em> border our property to the north and
west and elswhere in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Our house is adjacent to the historic Old Nakasendō (Central Mountain
Route), “one of the centrally administered five walking routes of the
Edo period, and one of the two that connected the <em>de facto</em> capital
of Japan at Edo (modern-day Tokyo) to Kyoto [the old capital]”,
“official routes for the use of the Shōgun and the other Daimyō
[feudal lords]” [—<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakasend%C5%8D">Wikipedia</a>]. Our property is near Otai-shuku, one
of the “post towns” (#21) or rest areas where people would stop on
their journeys. For a personal pilgrimage/challenge many people still
walk the 534 km route between Tōkyō and Kyōto, which takes about 3
weeks. About a week after leaving Tōkyō they pass right by our house!</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The front entrance or “<em>genkan</em>” features a step up to the main
floor. We always take off and leave our outside shoes here, step up,
and (optionally) put on slippers. If your feet are larger than US
men’s size 8, you may want to bring your own slippers.</p>
<p>In most houses when you enter a <em>tatami</em>-floored <em>washitsu</em>, you
take off your slippers and wear socks or bare feet. This is to avoid
scuffing the delicate <em>tatami</em> surface. We don’t observe this custom
in our house; we just try to keep our floors and slippers clean. The
<em>tatami</em> mats are old and we’re treating them as ordinary flooring.</p>
<p>It’s also common to take off your slippers and put on special
slippers/sandals when entering a toilet room or the bathroom. We
don’t observe this custom either.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Our guest rooms on the ground floor are “<em>washitsu</em>”: Japanese-style
<em>tatami</em>-floored multifuntion rooms with Western-style beds. When we
don’t have guests, they are our formal living rooms and overflow
space.</p>
<p>These rooms are separated by sliding doors. Some are <em>fusuma</em>
(cloth-covered opaque sliding doors) and some are <em>shōji</em> (sliding
wood-framed doors with translucent <em>washi</em> paper screens and glass
panels). All are pretty thin: not much sound insulation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Doorways into the kitchen and into all of the <em>washitsu</em> are low,
about 175 cm (5'9&quot;). If you’re taller than this (like David) be
careful to duck or you’ll hit your head (like David does
occasionally; ouch!). Other doorways are reasonably high.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In the northeast corner of the house is our kitchen, which you’re
welcome to use: refrigerator, microwave/grill combination oven, gas
range, toaster oven, etc. We’re always well stocked with snacks,
both Japanese &amp; Western.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">South of the kitchen is our great room:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The dining room where we’ll share meals is another <em>washitsu</em>, but
with a Western dining table and chairs.</li>
<li>The media room, adjacent to the dining room on the south side, is
Western-style (wood flooring), and contains our extensive media
collection, which you’re welcome to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2025 we took down the wall between the dining room and the media
room, added a wood pellet stove, and created our combined “great
room”.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There’s only a single bathroom (the room with the bath). See <a class="reference external" href="bathing.html">How to
Use a Japanese Bath</a>. We provide towels, soap, and shampoo.</p>
<p>There are <a class="reference internal" href="#onsen-hot-spring-baths">onsen hot spring baths</a> nearby. A recommended
experience!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The anteroom to the bathroom has a washbasin and is also our laundry
room with a washing machine and a dryer (a rare luxury in Japan).
You’re welcome to use it!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The toilets are in their own separate small/tiny rooms, true “water
closets”. We have one toilet on the ground floor, and a second
toilet upstairs — rare for a house this old!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There’s no central heating or air conditioning. We only heat and
cool the rooms we’re actually using. We have several individual air
conditioner / heat pump units for cooling. For heaters we have a
pellet stove in the great room and “fan heaters” (natural gas &amp;
kerosene) for individual rooms. We wear sweaters and warm slippers
during cold weather.</p>
