Saku, Nagano
============

We chose to live in Saku because of its relatively cool (or at least
bearable) summers due to its location in the mountains (elevation 760
m ≈ 2500 ft).
In exchange, we experience cold winters.
Because ours is an old house, when it’s cold outside it’s cold inside
as well.

Saku is a city of approximately 100,000 residents spread out over 423
km² in the eastern part of central Nagano Prefecture.
Saku was formed by the agglomeration of multiple towns (Iwamurada,
Nakagomi, Nozawa, Usuda, Mochizuki, Asashina, Asama) which remain
distinct neighborhoods with their own downtowns.
Much of Saku remains agricultural.
Our house is in a residential neighborhood in the northeast part of
Saku with shopping nearby, but farm fields, woods, and the Yu River
are only a few minutes walk away.

Saku contains the point furthest from the sea within Honshū island and
is surrounded by mountains: the Asama Range to the north, Mount Hirao
to the east, and Mount Tatéshina & the Yatsugatake Mountain Range to
the south.
Saku has relatively little precipitation and many sunny days thanks to
these mountains.
Saku has hot and humid summers and relatively mild winters.
Mount Asama is a volcano, mildly active for now; the last major
eruption was over 200 years ago.

In 1997 the Hokuriku Shinkansen bullet train line (formerly the Nagano
Shinkansen) opened with Sakudaira station in Saku.
From Sakudaira Station it takes 70-85 minutes to Tokyo Station (some
trains skip smaller stations).
Many people now commute to Tokyo by bullet train.
Saku is also connected to surrounding areas by local trains.
The area around Sakudaira station has become the downtown area of
greater Saku, with a shopping center, large stores, many restaurants,
and a community park.

Immediately to the east of Saku is Gunma Prefecture.
To the north are the towns of Komoro (population 42,000), Miyota
(15,000), and Karuizawa (a famous resort town where wealthy people
have summer homes; population 20,000).
To the west is the town of Tateshina (7100).
Further to the west of Saku are the cities of Ueda (157,000), Nagano
(the capital of Nagano Prefecture; population 365,000), and Matsumoto
(239,000).


Our Home
========

As a guest in our home you will experience staying in a real
late-*Shōwa*-era Japanese house, built in 1977.
The experience will be similar to staying at a *minshuku*:

    *Minshuku* are a low-budget version of *ryokan*, roughly
    equivalent to a British boarding house or a bed and breakfast.
    The facilities... may simply consist of spare rooms in a family
    home.
    *Minshuku* often serve as the only type of accommodation in towns
    or villages too small to warrant a dedicated hotel or *ryokan*.
    The overall experience is much the same, but the food is simpler,
    dining may be optional and is often communal, rooms don’t usually
    have a private toilet, and guests may have to lay out their own
    bedding.

    — Wikipedia__

    __ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan#Minshuku

Ours is a big house for two people by Japanese standards, but modest
by Canadian standards: 177 m² (≈ 1900 sq.ft) including storage spaces,
hallways, and even the thickness of the walls.
Like most houses in Japan, there’s no basement.
When we bought the house in 2024 it had been empty for 5 years, one of
Japan’s many *akiya* (empty houses).
When it was built our house replaced a much older and larger house
(“*minka*”).
The family who used to live here were coincidentally also named
Takahashi (it’s the third most common family name in Japan) and many
relatives live in the area, some nearby.
The Takahashi family were local farmers, and many farming tools and
supplies came with the house.

Our property’s land area is 530 m² ≈ 5700 sq.ft., mostly filled by the
house and 4 outbuildings: a 2-car garage, a 2-storey grain storehouse,
a small shed in front of the house, and a large shed in the back.
We plan to remove the large shed in the back, freeing up space for a
yard or for a vegetable garden, and the small shed in the front,
freeing up space for a deck or for a small yard or for a traditional
Japanese decorative garden.
There’s a small empty property to the east (211 m² ≈ 2270 sq.ft), and
other *akiya* border our property to the north and west and exist
elswhere in the neighborhood.

Our house is adjacent to the historic Old Nakasendō (Central Mountain
Route), “one of the centrally administered five walking routes of the
Edo period, and one of the two that connected the *de facto* capital
of Japan at Edo (modern-day Tokyo) to Kyoto [the old capital]”,
“official routes for the use of the Shōgun and the other Daimyō
[feudal lords]” [—Wikipedia__].
Our property is near Otai-juku, one of the “post towns” (#21) or rest
areas where people would stop on their journeys.
For a personal pilgrimage/challenge many people still walk the 534 km
route between Tōkyō and Kyōto, which takes about 3 weeks.
About a week after leaving Tōkyō they pass right by our house!

__ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakasend%C5%8D

Details:

* The front entrance or “*genkan*” features a step up to the main
  floor.
  We always take off and leave our outside shoes here, step up, and
  (optionally) put on slippers.
  If your feet are larger than US men’s size 8, you may want to bring
  your own slippers for visits to other houses.

  In most houses when you enter a *tatami*-floored *washitsu*, you
  take off your slippers and wear socks or bare feet.
  This is to avoid scuffing the delicate *tatami* surface.
  We don’t observe this custom in our house; we just try to keep our
  floors and slippers clean.
  The *tatami* mats are old and we’re treating them as ordinary
  flooring.

  It’s also common to take off your slippers and put on special
  slippers/sandals when entering a toilet room or the bathroom.
  We don’t observe this custom either.

* Our guest rooms on the ground floor are “*washitsu*”: Japanese-style
  *tatami*-floored multifuntion rooms with Western-style beds.
  When we don’t have guests, they are our formal living rooms and
  overflow space.

  These rooms are separated by sliding doors.
  Some are *fusuma* (cloth-covered opaque sliding doors) and some are
  *shōji* (sliding wood-framed doors with translucent *washi* paper
  screens and glass panels).
  All are pretty thin: not much sound insulation.

* Doorways into the kitchen and into all of the *washitsu* are low,
  about 175 cm (5'9").
  If you’re taller than this (like David) be careful to duck or you’ll
  hit your head (like David does occasionally; ouch!).
  Other doorways are reasonably high.

* In the northeast corner of the house is our kitchen, which you’re
  welcome to use: refrigerator, microwave/grill combination oven, gas
  range, toaster oven, etc.
  We’re always well stocked with snacks, both Japanese & Western.

* South of the kitchen is our great room:

  * The dining room where we’ll share meals is another *washitsu*, but
    with a Western dining table and chairs.

  * The media room, adjacent to the dining room on the south side, is
    Western-style (wood flooring), and contains our extensive media
    collection, which you’re welcome to use.

  In 2025 we took down the wall between the dining room and the media
  room, added a wood pellet stove, and created our combined “great
  room”.

* There’s only a single bathroom (the room with the bath).
  See `How to Use a Japanese Bath`_.
  We provide towels, soap, and shampoo.

  There are `onsen hot spring baths`_ nearby.
  A recommended experience!

* The anteroom to the bathroom has a washbasin and is also our laundry
  room with a washing machine and a dryer (a rare luxury in Japan).
  You’re welcome to use it!

* The toilets are in their own separate small/tiny rooms, true “water
  closets”.
  We have one toilet on the ground floor, and a second toilet upstairs
  — rare for a house this old!

* There’s no central heating or air conditioning.
  We only heat and cool the rooms we’re actually using.
  We have several individual air conditioner / heat pump units for
  cooling.
  For heaters we have a pellet stove in the great room and “fan
  heaters” (natural gas & kerosene) for individual rooms.
  We wear sweaters and warm slippers during cold weather.


Ideas For Dining In
===================

* *Onabé* is a chunky soup/stew with a variety of broths and
  ingredients, great in cold weather.

* Barbecue: we inherited years worth of wood charcoal (not briquettes)
  along with the house!
  Burgers, chicken, fish, etc.

* A typical *téishoku* or “set meal” includes rice, *miso* soup, and a
  salad.
  This is in addition to the *okazu*, the featured entrée, like fish
  or meat or sautéed vegetables.

Examples of meals/entrées, from March & April 2025:

.. class:: multicolumn

* breakfast-style (egg mcmuffin, sausages, hash browns;
  scrambled/fried eggs & bacon)
* omelette
*  *chirashi-zushi* with tuna, *unagi*, *ika*, egg, *ikura*, etc.
* *inari-zushi*
* stuffed green peppers (*pīman*) with roasted carrots & potatoes
* ginger pork
* *yakisoba*
* *yakitori*
* fried breaded oysters & fish
* sautéed veggies, alone or with shrimp or sausages etc.
* cream croquettes & *chikuwa*
* *tonkotsu rāmen* with *chāshū* & egg & *gyōza*
* grilled fish (salmon, *aka-zakana*, *saba*/mackerel, etc.)
* fried breaded minced pork
* tacos
* chicken & mushroom & *konnyaku* & veggie stir-fry with fish sausages
* hamburger with mushrooms
* *kata-yakisoba* with shrimp & veggies
* Indian curry with *naan*
* Japanese curry on rice
