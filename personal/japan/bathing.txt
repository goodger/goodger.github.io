Bathing is an important part of Japanese culture, and bathing in Japan
is very different from bathing in Western societies.

A Japanese bathroom (“*ofurō*” or “*yoku-shitsu*”) is the room with
the bath, used for washing/showering and soaking.
It’s like a combination shower stall and hot tub.
Unlike a typical Western bathroom, the entire room is meant to get
wet, but we do NOT wash in the tub!
In Japan, bathtubs are for relaxing, not for cleaning the body.
This is because the tub’s hot water is shared by the entire household.

The toilet is usually in a separate small (often tiny) room, a true
water closet.
Exceptions are hotel rooms and small apartments, where the bath and
sink (and often the toilet) are all together in one small room (a
“unit bath”).
You need to take care (or use special sandals) to keep your feet from
getting wet from shower water remaining on the floor when you use the
sink and/or the toilet.

Specifics of **[home]** baths and **[onsen]** hotspring baths are
indicated below.

* **[Home:]** If you want to take a bath, please let your host know in
  advance.
  It takes a while to fill the tub, and everyone who wants a bath will
  need to coordinate.

* First, wash outside of the tub.
  Get yourself wet, lather up, clean thoroughly, and rinse off
  completely.
  No soap in the tub!
  Many people wash & rinse twice.

  * **[Home:]** There’s a plastic stool available to sit on while you
    wash.
    Of course, you’re welcome to stand instead.
    There’s a bucket if you’d like to douse yourself instead of (or in
    addition to) using the showerhead.

    There’s a button on the showerhead to stop the flow to conserve
    water while you’re lathering up.

  * **[Onsen:]** While some *onsen* have stand-up shower stalls, most
    stalls require you to sit to wash.
    They provide stools & buckets.
    Be careful not to spray or splash your neighbors, who may be quite
    nearby.

    The water controls often require you to push a lever or button
    every 15 to 30 seconds to continue the flow.

* Once you’re completely clean and thoroughly rinsed off, get into the
  tub to soak.

  * **[Home:]** Please get into the tub slowly.
    It’s okay for a little bit of water to overflow, but if there’s a
    lot of overflow, please don’t flood the floor (water can get past
    the door).
    Instead, push the drain button near the control panel until the
    water level is low enough to prevent overflow.

  * **[Home:]** The tub will automatically be replenished with hot
    water to maintain the temperature.
    Any hair or oils that float to the top of the water should be
    skimmed off; there’s a handled scoop available for this.

  * **[Onsen]** usually have multiple baths with different
    temperatures (extra-hot, cold) or types of water (e.g. specially
    scented), and one or more outdoor baths called “*rotenburō*”.
    *Rotenburō* are one of the best features of *onsen*.
    A *rotenburō* with a view is a great experience!

* Relax and take as long as you like!
  Be careful of overheating though.
  You can sit up on a seat or on the edge of the tub.

* Stand up slowly when you get out of the tub, and use the hand rails.
  After soaking in hot water, standing up quickly commonly causes low
  blood pressure resulting in dizziness, lightheadedness, and even
  fainting.

* **[Home:]** When you’re done, do NOT drain the tub.
  The hot water will be used by everyone taking a bath that day, like
  a hot tub.
  Please put the insulated covers over the tub.

  We typically don’t use it, but our water heater can filter & reheat
  the water so it can be used for several days.

* Once you’re done in the tub, you may want to wash your face (one
  tends to sweat) and rinse off again with the shower.
  Try a cool(er) shower for the final rinse.

*Onsen*-specific notes:

* The first time you visit an *onsen* you will probably feel
  uncomfortable, but give it a try!
  If you can get over being completely naked among strangers (it
  doesn’t take long) you may end up loving it.

* Almost all *onsen* are segregated by gender.
  Those that aren’t segregated tend to have separate entrances to the
  baths and opaque water.

* You will need to bring a washcloth, a small towel (for initial
  drying), a larger towel (for complete drying), and a change of
  clothes.
  Bring the washcloth and the small towel into the washing area.
  Leave the large towel and your clothes in the changing area. Lockers
  are provided, but they often require a ¥100 coin (returned when
  you’re done).
  Sometimes there are only small lockers for your valuables (wallet,
  phone, etc.) and you leave your clothes in a cubby in the changing
  area.

* You absolutely DO NOT enter the bath unless you are completely clean
  and fully rinsed.
  Absolutely no soap is allowed in the bath water.

* Some people use a small towel for modesty.
  If you do, be sure to keep it out of the bath water.
  Either set it on the side of the tub or put it on top of your head!

* Most *onsen* refuse entry to guests with tattoos, because tattoos
  are associated with organized crime (*yakuza*).
  If you have a small tattoo, best to cover it with a waterproof
  bandage.
  If you have large or multiple tattoos, you’ll have to find
  permissive *onsen*!

* Most *onsen* have restaurants.
  Best to eat *after* you bathe though.
