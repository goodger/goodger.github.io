    The peculiar evil genius of Amazon is that Amazon seems to be
    trying to simultaneously establish a wholesale monopsony and a
    retail monopoly in the ebook sector.

    The real driver for piracy is the lack of convenient access to
    desirable content at a competitive price.

    By foolishly insisting on DRM, and then selling to Amazon on a
    wholesale basis, the publishers handed Amazon a monopoly on their
    customers — and thereby empowered a predatory monopsony.

    If the major publishers switch to selling ebooks without DRM, then
    they can enable customers to buy books from a variety of outlets
    and move away from the walled garden of the Kindle store. They see
    DRM as a defense against piracy, but piracy is a much less
    immediate threat than a gigantic multinational with revenue of $48
    Billion in 2011 (more than the entire global publishing industry)
    that has expressed its intention to “disrupt” them, and whose
    chief executive said recently “even well-meaning gatekeepers slow
    innovation” (where “innovation” is code-speak for “opportunities
    for me to turn a profit”).

    Good ideas are like butterflies: they may land, but they soon take
    off again. Write them down!

    -- Brian Luke Seaward, `Managing Stress`

    Ideas are like soap bubbles.  They can pop or float away so
    easily.  Then they’re gone forever.

    One idea leads to another, like bubbles coming out together.
    ... The trick is to catch them before they disappear.

    Never trust your memory.  All too often what seems like a
    marvelous idea at midnight is gone in the morning.

    Write them down.  ...  Do whatever you have to do to hold onto an
    idea until you have time to sit down at your desk with it and see
    where it goes. Even if most ideas turn out to be like the little
    bubbles that break as soon as they hit the air, don’t let them
    go. You never know which bit of nonsense will turn out to be the
    bubble that floats all the way to heaven.

    -- Sue Lick, `Capture Those Ideas Before They Float Away

    Ideas are like dreams, if you don’t write them down they
    disappear.

    -- Roald Dahl

    Ideas are like the sparkling fireflies; they happen randomly and
    unless you have reached Nirvana, you can hardly control them. It
    is always better to devise a mechanism to preserve them whenever
    they grace you.

    | In your life expect some trouble

    -- Bobby McFerrin, “Don’t Worry, Be Happy”

    The old and powerful never want to let go.  They always think
    they’re both profoundly indispensable and uniquely right.  They
    are always wrong.  Part of the function of ageing and dying is to
    let the next generation have its say, its time in the sun, to
    sweep away the mistakes of the previous age while, if they’re
    lucky, retaining the advances made and the benefits accrued.

    And the greatest arrogance of all: “save the planet.” What? Are
    these fucking people kidding me? Save the planet, we don’t even
    know how to take care of ourselves yet. We haven’t learned how to
    care for one another, we’re gonna save the fucking planet?

    There is nothing wrong with the planet. The planet is fine. The
    **people** are fucked. ... Compared to the people, the planet is
    doing great. ... The planet has been here four and a half billion
    years. We’ve been here, what, a hundred thousand?  Maybe two
    hundred thousand? And we’ve only been engaged in heavy industry
    for a little over two hundred years. Two hundred years versus four
    and a half billion.  And we have the *conceit* to think that
    somehow we’re a threat? That somehow we’re gonna put in jeopardy
    this beautiful little blue-green ball that’s just a-floatin’
    around the sun?

    ...  The planet isn’t going anywhere. **We are!** ... The
    planet’ll shake us off like a bad case of fleas. ...

    The planet will be here for a long, long, **long** time after
    we’re gone, and it will heal itself, it will cleanse itself,
    ’cause that’s what it does. It’s a self-correcting system. The air
    and the water will recover, the earth will be renewed, and if it’s
    true that plastic is not degradable, well, the planet will simply
    incorporate plastic into a new pardigm: the Earth plus plastic.
    The Earth doesn’t share our prejudice towards plastic. Plastic
    came out of the Earth. The Earth probably sees plastic as just
    another one of its children. Could be the only reason the Earth
    allowed us to be spawned from it in the first place. It wanted
    plastic for itself. Didn’t know how to make it. Needed us. Could
    be the answer to our age-old egocentric philosophical question,
    “Why are we here?” *Plastic, assholes.*

    Obscurity, not piracy, is the biggest problem writers face. In the
    21st century, if you are not making art with the intention of it
    being copied, you are not making contemporary art.

    It’s how we all learn to do stuff. That’s how we are, we are
    descendants of molecules formed a million years ago because they

    **Uncritical thinking kills**

    The most important thing [a parent] can do for [their children] is
    to teach [them] how to live in the real world.  And that means
    showing [them] how to think. Not *what* to think, but *how*.

    Question authority. Be skeptical of claims. Ask for
    evidence. Apply good logic. Avoid bad logic. Analyze the
    results. Look for bias.

    And doubt. Doubt *doubt* **doubt**. It’s one of the greatest
    strengths of the human mind, and perhaps the least used of all.

    Too many people choose not to think. But our technology, our
    society, our impact is vast, and now, *today*, in *this* world,
    that choice is one we can no longer afford.

    People say “time is money”, but the fact is, time is a lot more

    Too many people go through life complaining about their problems.

Free/Libre & Open Source Software (FLOSS)
=========================================

    As our society grows more dependent on computers, the software we
    run is of critical importance to securing the future of a free
    society. Free software is about having control over the technology
    we use in our homes, schools and businesses, where computers work
    for our individual and communal benefit, not for proprietary
    software companies or governments who might seek to restrict and
    monitor us.

    -- `About the Free Software Foundation
       <http://www.fsf.org/about/>`__

    An appliance is not a stripped-down computer — it is a fully
    functional computer with spyware on it out of the box.

    Digital rights management always converges on malware.

    As a member of the Walkman generation, I have made peace with the
    fact that I will require a hearing aid long before I die, and of
    course, it won’t be a hearing aid, it will be a computer I put in
    my body. So when I get into a car (a computer I put my body into)
    with my hearing aid (a computer I put inside my body) I want to
    know that these technologies are not designed to keep secrets from
    me, and to prevent me from terminating processes on them that work
    against my interests.

    Freedom in the future will require us to have the capacity to
    monitor our devices and set meaningful policy on them, to examine
    and terminate the processes that run on them, to maintain them as
    honest servants to our will, and not as traitors and spies working
    for criminals, thugs, and control freaks.

    Proprietary software is an unsafe building material.

    You can’t inspect it.  You can’t assess its complex failure modes
    easily, by simply poking at the finished article.  And most
    important of all, if you were aware of a [safety] problem ... that
    you could fix, you couldn’t fix it.  If you were aware of a
    catastrophic failure mode, you couldn’t do anything about it --
    except ask the manufacturer to fix it... who sells software to
    consumers under shrinkwrap... which basically says, “if the
    software fails catastrophically and obliterates your town, we’ll
    give you your money back.”

    So proprietary software is an unsafe building material.  We
    shouldn’t use it for purposes that could conceivably cause harm,
    like running personal computers.  Let alone should we use it for
    things like anti-lock brakes or throttle control in automobiles.

    We wouldn’t allow people to build black-box elevators.  They’ve
    got to be inspectable.  And they have to be repairable by the
    people in whose buildings they are.  That’s a sensible rule,
    arrived at over a long period of experience with what can happen
    when things fall.  Which you would expect us to carry unchanged
    into our experience of the digital environment, but which is not.

    The basic principle of the difficulty that we face is we can’t see
    enough and we can’t modify it fast enough to ... [assess] what
    went wrong after it fails.  What we actually need is the ability
    to harness civil society to prevent failure.

    This is a problem which can be prevented more easily than it can
    be coped with after the fact.

    You give away the *infinite* goods, not the *scarce* goods.  Your
    time is a *scarce* good.  No one is saying that everything needs
    to be free -- they’re saying that infinite goods *will* be free,
    because of it’s very nature in economics. ...  Most programmers
    don’t earn any kind of royalties for the software they write.
    They are paid a salary, for their time -- but not for the software
    itself (which is an infinite good).  And, I won’t even get into
    the number of programmers who work on open source projects for
    free...

    But free alone isn’t a business model.  And it’s wrong to blame
    free for the lack of establishing a complete business model. Just
    because “give it away and pray” isn’t a workable business model,

    My view is it’s just the unrolling of a thing that came from very
    far, long ago.  It’s a reversal of a local eddy in the current of
    time.  Microsoft made it appear that software was a product, for a
    little while.  But knowledge is rarely a product, and the
    technological information about the terms on which we and the
    digital brains exist [i.e. software], that’s not a product.
    That’s a culture.  That’s the record of a deposit of human beings
    and the “other” in conversation.  It’s like literature: it can’t
    be a product.  So what we are discovering is it’s a culture made
    by communities.  And we could have known that in 1965 or 1970.  It
    was hard to see in 1990.  But it’s easy to see again in 2006.  In
    my judgement, this is in that historical sense more about clearing
    away a temporary confusion than it is about some strange and
    amazing departure that suddenly occurred.

    Here are some general principles applicable to open source
    projects (including Docutils):

    * If it’s important to you, you should see it done.
    * If you don’t do it, nobody else will.
    * If you do it right, it will succeed and be adopted by others.
    * If making changes to a project is important enough to you, and
      the project leaders don’t listen, consider forking the project.
      But discuss your ideas thoroughly first.

    If open source is the soil from which your business has sprouted,
    it makes sense to keep the soil healthy.

    Open source does not allow for exclusive access to the inner
    workings of anything. That’s what it means.

    And if there is anything I’ve learnt from Linux, it’s that
    projects have a life of their own, and you should _not_ try to
    enforce your “vision” too strongly on them.  Most often you’re
    wrong anyway, and if you’re not flexible and willing to take input
    from others (and willing to change direction when it turned out
    your vision was flawed), you’ll never get anything good done.

    Your company may not have the resources to maintain an operating
    system or other major piece of software on its own, but if that
    software is essential to your business, it is likely to be
    essential to many others with whom you can cooperate to keep it
    alive and growing -- and your company’s share of that new
    project’s costs will almost certainly be less than you’d spend to
    purchase equivalent proprietary software.

       it all around.
    5. The easier you make it to do things, the more people will be

Programming
===========

    Be transparent. Share your work constantly. Solicit
    feedback. Appreciate critiques. Let other people point out your
    mistakes. You are not your code. Do not be afraid of day-to-day
    failures — learn from them. (As they say at Google, “don’t run
    from failure — fail often, fail quickly, and learn.”) Cherish your
    history, both the successes and mistakes. All of these behaviors
    are the way to get better at programming. If you don’t follow
    them, you’re cheating your own personal development.

    1. Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean
       interfaces.

    2. Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.

    3. Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected with other
       programs.

    4. Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate
       interfaces from engines.

    5. Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only
       where you must.

    6. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by
       demonstration that nothing else will do.

    7. Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection
       and debugging easier.

    8. Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and
       simplicity.

    9. Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data, so program
       logic can be stupid and robust.

    10. Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the
        least surprising thing.

    11. Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say,
        it should say nothing.

    12. Rule of Repair: Repair what you can -- but when you must fail,
        fail noisily and as soon as possible.

    13. Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in
        preference to machine time.

    14. Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to
        write programs when you can.

    15. Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it
        working before you optimize it.

    16. Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for one true way.

    17. Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will
        be here sooner than you think.

    -- attributed to US Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan

    The question I was asking [in the film `Riligulous
    <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815241/>`__] was, how can otherwise
    intelligent people believe in a talking snake?  How do people
    build this wall in their mind between what they *must* know, in
    part of their mind, is untrue, and yet they maintain this belief?

    If it was as simple as saying, all the smart people are atheists
    and all the stupid people are religulous, it would be very simple.
    But it’s not that simple, because we all know very intelligent
    people who somehow put that wall up in their mind.  That doesn’t
    mean I respect it intellectually.  ...  If you do hold that
    belief, if you believe in Santa Claus, a god, Jesus, whatever you
    want, I really have to disqualify you from the highest rank of
    thinkers.  I’m sorry, I just do.

    If you believe in something that is *obviously ridiculous* and
    anachronistic, something that some desert-dweller had as a brain
    fart 3000 years ago, wrote down, and somehow it got passed along
    in a game of telephone, and now you’re still following it?  I’m
    sorry, you can’t be in the higest rank of thinkers.  Amen!

    If you walk up to something and say, “This is irreducibly
    complex,” which means of course that there is no way this can have
    existed in a simpler form and function, *and* it contains some
    complexity that we will never understand, thereby requiring some
    kind of intelligent force operating on it.  Here’s what’s
    particularly ... inexcusiably hubristic.  It’s [someone who says],
    “*I* can’t figure out how this works, and so no one alive today
    can figure out how this works, no one who will ever be born will
    figure out how this works.  Therefore it is intelligently
    designed.”  That is the height of hubristic thinking, to assert
    that because you can’t figure it out, no one who will ever be born
    after you will be able to do so as well.

    -- *ibid*

    In science, if you can’t admit you don’t know, you will never make
    a discovery in your life.  The scientist has to not only be
    comfortable with ignorance, but embrace it.  Because therein is
    that force which attracts you to the frontier where you put a foot
    in what is known, a foot in what is unknown, and you investigate
    with the intent of discovery.

    You get these newspaper articles where a new science result comes
    out and the lead sentence is, “Scientists will be sent back to the
    drawing board.  They’re baffled.”  If you’re an active research
    scientist, you are always at the drawing board.  You are always
    baffled.  That is not a new state.  That is a permanent state.
    The idea that a scientist might not know something is presented as 
    presented as some kind of major finding in the newspapers.  But in
    fact that’s a daily finding.

    -- Carl Sagan

    I think the roots of this antagonism to science run very deep.
    They’re ancient.  We see them in Genesis, this first story, this
    founding myth of ours, in which the first humans are doomed and
    cursed eternally for asking a question, for partaking of the fruit
    of the Tree of Knowledge.  It’s puzzling that Eden is synonymous
    with paradise when, if you think about it at all, it’s more like a
    maximum-security prison with twenty-four hour surveillance.  It’s
    a horrible place.  Adam and Eve have no childhood.  They awaken
    full-grown.  What is a human being without a childhood?  Our long
    childhood is a critical feature of our species.  It differentiates
    us, to a degree, from most other species.  We take a longer time
    to mature.  We depend upon these formative years and the social
    fabric to learn many of the things we need to know.

    -- Ann Druyan

    When my husband [Carl Sagan] died, because he was so famous and

    end and converted to a belief in an afterlife.  They also
    frequently ask me if I think I will see him again.  Carl faced his

    How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and
    concluded, “This is better than we thought!  The Universe is much
    bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more
    elegant”?  Instead they say, “No, no, no!  My god is a little god,
    and I want him to stay that way.”  A religion, old or new, that
    stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern
    science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe
    hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.

    But just what is the core of Dawkins’ radical message?  Well, it
    goes something like this: If you claim that something is true, I

    My suggestion is that you won’t find any intelligent person who

    The wisdom is accessible to us.  We’re not a stupid race.  We
    invented the zipper; we can do it.

    I see religion as one of the last overwhelming vestiges of
    barbarism in our culture.

    All of this recourse to religious thinking -- expressions like “we
    shouldn’t play God”, etc. -- how do we get past all that?  How do
    we manage to get beyond it so that we become rational beings
    instead of irrational beings?  That to me is the central question.

    Philosophy is questions that may never be answered.  Religion is
    answers that may never be questioned.

    It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to
    persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.

    -- Carl Sagan

    I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing.  I think
    it’s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have
    answers which might be wrong.  ... But I don’t have to know an
    answer.  I don’t feel frightened by not knowing things, by being
    lost in a mysterious universe without having any purpose -- which
    is the way it really is, as far as I can tell.  It doesn’t
    frighten me.

    -- Richard Feynman

    Human beings are perhaps never more frightening than when they are
    convinced beyond doubt that they are right.

    Nonbelievers like myself stand beside you, dumbstruck by the
    Muslim hordes who chant death to whole nations of the living.  But
    we stand dumbstruck by *you* as well -- by your denial of tangible
    reality, by the suffering you create in service to your religious
    myths, and by your attachment to an imaginary God.

    -- Sam Harris, `Letter to a Christian Nation`

    We’re going to look back and be amazed that we approached this
    asymptote of destructive capacity while allowing ourselves to be
    balkanized by fantasy. ... At some point, there is going to be
    enough pressure that it is just going to be too *embarrassing* to
    believe in God.

    -- Sam Harris, quoted in `Wired News: Battle of the New Atheism
       <http://www.wired.com/news/wiredmag/0,71985-0.html>`__

    We explain our existence by a combination of the anthropic
    principle and Darwin’s principle of natural selection.  That
    combination provides a complete and deeply satisfying explanation
    for everything that we see and know.  Not only is the god
    hypothesis unnecessary. It is spectacularly unparsimonious.  Not
    only do we need no God to explain the universe and life.  God
    stands out in the universe as the most glaring of all superfluous
    sore thumbs.  We cannot, of course, disprove God, just as we can’t
    disprove Thor, fairies, leprechauns and the Flying Spaghetti
    Monster.  But, like those other fantasies that we can’t disprove,
    we can say that God is very very improbable.

    As a scientist, I’m increasingly worried about how faith is
    undermining science.  It’s something we must resist, because
    irrational faith is feeding murderous intolerance throughout the
    world.

    -- Richard Dawkins, “Root of All Evil? part 2: The Virus of
       Faith”, Channel 4 Television Corporation (2006)

    Science weighs up evidence and advances.  Religion is hidebound
    belief for belief’s sake.  It’s bad for our children, and it’s bad
    for you.

    -- Richard Dawkins, “Root of All Evil? part 2: The Virus of
       Faith”, Channel 4 Television Corporation (2006)

    Let me explain why, when it comes to children, I think of religion
    as a dangerous virus.  It’s a virus which is transmitted partly
    through teachers and clergy, but also down the generations from
    parent to child to grandchild.  Children are especially vulnerable
    to infection by the virus of religion.

    A child is genetically pre-programmed to accumulate knowledge from
    figures of authority.  The child brain, for very good Darwinian
    reasons, has to be set up in such a way that it believes what it’s
    told by its elders, because there just isn’t time for the child to
    experiment with warnings like “Don’t go too near the cliff edge!”
    or “Don’t swim in the river, there are crocodiles!”  Any child who
    applied a scientific sceptical questioning attitude to that, would
    be dead.

    No wonder the Jesuits said, “Give me the child for his first seven
    years and I’ll give you the man.”

    The child brain will automatically believe what it’s told even if
    what it’s told is nonsense.  And then when the child grows up it
    will tend to pass on that same nonsense to its children.

    And so religion goes on from generation to generation.

    For many people, part of growing up is killing off the virus of
    faith with a good strong dose of rational thinking.  But if an
    individual doesn’t succeed in shaking it off, his mind is stuck in
    a permanent state of infancy.  And there is a real danger that he
    will infect the next generation.

    -- Richard Dawkins, “Root of All Evil? part 2: The Virus of
       Faith”, Channel 4 Television Corporation (2006)

    Nobody not brought up in the faith could reach any verdict other
    than: barking mad.

    -- Richard Dawkins, “Root of All Evil? part 2: The Virus of
       Faith”, Channel 4 Television Corporation (2006)

    Religion is an insult to human dignity.  With or without it you
    would have good people doing good things and evil people doing
    evil things.  But for good people to do evil things, that takes
    religion.

    -- Steven Weinberg, Nobel-prize-winning theoretical physicist

    Some say that while religious fundamentalists betray reason,
    moderate believers betray reason and faith equally.

    -- Richard Dawkins, “Root of All Evil? part 2: The Virus of
       Faith”, Channel 4 Television Corporation (2006)

    ... the brain is responsible for consciousness.  And we can be
    reasonably sure that when that brain ceases to be, when it falls
    apart and decomposes, that will be the end of us.  From that quite
    a lot of things follow, especially morally.  We are the very
    privileged owners of a brief spark of consciousness.  And we
    therefore have to take responsibility for it.  We cannot rely, as
    Christians or Muslims do, on a world elsewhere, a paradise, to
    which one can work towards and maybe make sacrifices, and,
    crucially, make sacrifices of other people.  We have a marvelous
    gift.  When you see it develop in children, this ability to become
    aware that other people have minds just like your own and feelings
    that are just as important as your own, and this gift of empathy
    seems to me to be the building block of our moral system.

    ...

    And if you have a sacred text that tells you how the world began
    or what the relationship is between this sky-god and you, it does
    curtail your curiosity, it cuts off a source of wonder.  The
    loveliness of the world in its wondrousness is not apparent to me
    in Islam or Christianity and all the other major religions.

    -- Ian McEwen, interviewed in “Root of All Evil? part 2: The Virus
       of Faith”, Channel 4 Television Corporation (2006)

    Look around you.  Nature demands our attention, begs us to
    explore, to question.  Religion can only provide facile,
    ultimately unsatisfying answers.  Science, in constantly seeking
    real explanations, reveals the true majesty of our world in all
    its complexity.

    People sometimes say, “there must be more than just this world,
    than just this life.”  But how much more do you want?!?

    -- Richard Dawkins, “Root of All Evil? part 2: The Virus of
       Faith”, Channel 4 Television Corporation (2006)

    We are privileged to be alive and we should make the most of our
    time on this world.

Getting Things Done
===================

    :ZH: For a lot of people your books are so full of mind-blowing
      and life-changing ideas, that they get overwhelmed.  They want
      to start, but don’t know how to.  What would be the best first
      step they can take to make a positive change?

    :Covey: Listen to your conscience regarding something that you
      simply know you should do, then start small on it—make a promise
      and keep it.  Then move forward and make a little larger promise
      and keep it.  Eventually you’ll discover that your sense of
      honor will become greater than your moods, and that will give
      you a level of confidence and excitement that you can move to
      other areas where you feel you need to make improvements or give
      service.

    :ZH: To give us some insight into your life, what is your typical
      morning routine on a work day, that incorporates some of your
      principles into your everyday life?

    :Covey: I make an effort every morning to win what I call the
      “private victory.”  I work out on a stationary bike while I am
      studying the scriptures for at least 30 minutes. Then I swim in
      a home pool vigorously for 15 minutes, then I do yoga in a
      shallow part of the pool for 15 minutes. Then I go into my
      library and pray with a listening spirit, listening primarily to
      my conscience while I visualize the rest of my entire day,
      including important professional activities and key
      relationships with my loved ones, working associates and
      clients. I see myself living by correct principles and
      accomplishing worthy purposes. One of my favorite quotes is,
      “The greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the
      silent chambers of one’s own soul.” (David O. McKay) Much of
      this listening and visualizing work is very challenging, so I
      win the private victory when I have made my mind up and commit
      to live by correct principles and to serve worthy purposes.

    GTD has helped me develop my own idea of what a project really is:

    1. It has more than one physical action.
    2. Its projected outcome is valuable, desirable, and well
       articulated (even if it needs to change or adapt as the
       project’s constraints evolve).
    3. Everyone involved in the project understands and agrees on the
       project’s value and desirable outcome (or, failing at that,
       they at least understand what their role in its envisionable
       success must be).
    4. It’s something to which I’ve made some kind of
       commitment--either a public commitment to others or even just a
       mental obligation I’ve made with myself. This is something in
       the world that I agree deserves my time and attention to the
       exclusion of other things.

       Stuff
       <http://www.43folders.com/2004/12/29/a-year-of-getting-things-done-part-1-the-good-stuff>`__

    My definition of “stuff” goes like this: Anything that has landed
    in your world, psychologically or physically, that doesn’t belong
    where it is, the way it is, for all eternity, but you haven’t
    decided what to do with it yet.

    You’ve received a letter ... you’ve opened it, you’ve read it, and
    that letter is still around.  ...  Why didn’t you throw it away?
    ...  This letter is now stuff, folks.  That letter does not belong
    where it is, the way it is, for all eternity in your life, but you
    haven’t decided what to do with it yet.  It now has a piece of you
    psychologically.

    -- from `a David Allen video
       <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-lvJAXZNmE>`__

    One of the core ideas in GTD is that the failing of a
    priority-based planning system is: it requires an incredible
    amount of conceit, because it assumes that you’re never going to
    be interrupted.  When in fact, for almost all of us our entire
    work day is nothing but interruption.

    ...

    I see GTD in the great pantheon as a subset of lifehacks, and not
    the other way around.  To me lifehacks are all about making a
    synaptic leap between the smart part of your brain and the dumb
    part of your brain.  Forcing these two parts of your brain that
    would otherwise have nothing to do with each other, forcing them
    to have a relationship that’s satisfying to everyone.

    ...

    [Your brain] is not an alarm clock, and it’s not a whiteboard.
    Find affordances for getting stuff into the physical world, into a
    system you trust, and then making it all about action instead of
    meta-work.

    ...

    Let’s be honest: multitasking is a myth.  The idea that you can
    actually do two things at once is a myth.  You *can* change modes
    very quickly and it *looks* like you’re doing two things at once.

    ...

    “How to become more Dude-like” is an excellent topic.  ...  The
    Dude had the right approach.

Here the original text and formatting is left intact and unedited:

    |         Unfine oneday there was two jollifriends, Badger and
    | Goodger, and one asses an utter “Quit fishing! and hand me
    | that tart while you’re at it.”
    |         “That’s a hell of a thing to call someone’s mother and
    | I’m sure she’s something’s mother or will be or could be.”
    |         “Metaphysics!” says Badger “I’m talking about pastry -
    | haven’t you got any and anyway who’s she?”
    |         “I’m glad you asked. She’s one of my splinter
    | personalities.”
    |         “ooo! I didn’t know that about you Goodger what’s that
    | she’s got all over her?”
    |         “Rasberry jam, I think, and don’t those seeds itch!”
    |         “I imagine they do. Mine do too.”
    |         “Actually, Badger, I think I’m peering my have-a-rod.”
    |         “Well make up your mind. If that’s not jam, it stinks.
    | What is this? The ocean?”
    |         “No, it’s a fairy tale.”
    |         “The hell it is.”
    |         “Well after a fashion anyway. But I think that is the
    | ocean you’re stepping in.”
    |         “Oh. Maybe that’s what stinks. Well now I wish that
    | you’d go back to metaphysics, because I’m certainly
    | not going to have sex with you.”
    |         “ I wasn’t asking. Have you had a look at your own
    | nose lately?”
    |         “Look whose talking!”
    |         “ Wellokay just a minute I will...”
    | ....so Goodger went off to a rock concert. He had some doped
    | cotton candy and went around snapping the elastics on
    | people’s pantyhose until he got unrested. Badger was stuck
    | on the beach with this sticky splinter personality who
    | smiled perfunctorily when Badger asked her anything but had
    | no suggestions as to what they should do.
    |         “Maybe we should be like in that poem and look for
    | oysters.”
    |         “Don’t look at me!” said the jam-covered unlady and
    | that was all she said from that time until the 16th
    | Century, which came back for a visit late that afternoon,
    | complete with pirates.
    |         “ I can’t say I dislike the costumes,” said the woman
    | “but they didn’t believe in schizophrenia back now so I’ll
    | have to be a devil WOWF!”
    |         The she-devil chased Badger up and down the beach
    | until 1952, when some people brought towels and an umbrella
    | and started to have a picnic.
    |         “Help! Help!” cried Badger “A woman that my friend
    | Goodger used to think that he sometimes was has turned into
    | a devil and...”
    |         Well you can imagine how this went over on Loose Rocks
    | Beach in 1952.
    |         “Are you human?” asked a little girl “Because if you
    | are you look pretty sick.”
    |         “Don’t strange to talkers.” said her father. “And for
    | gawdsake don’t stare. He was probably born that way.”
    |         “What are you implying?” said Badger, but at that
    | moment a big paw clapped down on his shoulder. Thinking it
    | was the she-devil, which in a way it was (for instance he
    | was in the way of where Mom was going to put the bowl of
    | fruit salad) -thinking, I say, that it was a succubus,
    | Badger leaped out of his hair and splashed into the water,
    | wading for France, where he hoped that it would be 1902 or
    | sometime quiet.
    |         “Wait!” cried Goodger, who had got out of prism by
    | exchanging faces with a dull old card sharp. “Wait! Wait!”
    | Badger thought that Goodger had said “Wade”, and so he
    | proceeded to swim just to be perverse. An oyster ate him.
    | Goodger sighed and chewed on some cotton candy. The little
    | girl grew up to be mayor of Fleabite, Oregon and the
    | pirates converted to Sikhs. An End.

By Others, About Me
===================

These first two were written by my good friend “Fearsclave” in his
`LiveJournal blog <http://www.livejournal.com/users/fearsclave>`__.
He uses “EKH” for my initials, weakly encoded [==
“DJG”.encode(‘rot1’)] to protect my identity.

    I spent the evening visiting my old friend EKH, who is pretty much
    your average Enlightenment philosopher’s ideal of a good human
    being whose life is governed by reason.  He has a lovely wife and
    two perfect kids.  He makes a living doing really arcane things
    that I do not even begin to understand in Python.  He is the most
    brilliant person I have ever met in terms of sheer brute abstract
    reasoning power.  He plays Go at a near-professional level, and is
    fluent in Japanese.  And he can build houses.  You want to be him.
    Trust me.  Or at least have him for a friend.

    It occurs to me that this is one area where I have been very
    lucky.

    -- http://www.livejournal.com/users/fearsclave/253063.html

I feel obligated to correct certain errors in the above:

* I wish my life were governed by reason, but the world is not always
  reasonable, and neither am I.
* My children are not perfect, but they’re good kids, `raised well
  (IMO) <beliefs.html#parenting>`__, and I’m proud of them.
* I like to think that I’m intelligent, but I don’t know how
  “brilliant” I am.  I can only assume that Fearsclave has not met so
  many people with “sheer brute abstract reasoning power”.
* I play go at about a 1-dan or 2-dan amateur level, hardly
  near-professional.
* My Japanese is conversational, but has plenty of holes.  My
  vocabulary, for example, sucks.
* I have *helped* my father (who *can* build houses) to build
  *additions* to houses, and am handy around my own house.
* You don’t want to be me, believe me.  I have plenty of problems of
  my own.

But I do appreciate the sentiment.  Right back at ya, man.

----------

    I get married tomorrow.  Yikes.  ...

    Also tomorrow, it’s my de facto niece Erika’s (daughter of my de
    facto brother EKH) birthday.  She’ll be at the wedding.  I plan on
    getting everybody to sing Happy Birthday to her.  And sticking
    candles on her piece of wedding cake.

`The God Delusion` by Richard Dawkins
=====================================

`The God Delusion` is a powerful book which contains a lot of truth.
Humanists, naturalists, `brights <http://the-brights.net/>`_,
freethinkers, “atheists”, and agnostics will find it a very
interesting and worthy read.  People “of faith” may find it a
challenge though—a challenge to their faith.  In fact, I challenge any
person of faith to read `The God Delusion` with an open mind and to
try to refute its arguments.  If their faith is entirely unaffected,
they must be deluding themselves.

There are so many good quotes in this book that I had to make a
special section for it.  Below, other people quoted in `The God
Delusion` are identified by name and page number.  Direct quotes of
Richard Dawkins’ words only show the page number.

    Isn’t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having
    to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?

    -- Douglas Adams, dedication page

    I’d take the awe of understanding over the awe of ignorance any
    day.

    -- Douglas Adams, p. 117

    Most scientists are bored by what they have already discovered.
    It is ignorance that drives them on.

    -- Matt Ridley, p. 125

    Mystics exult in mystery and want it to stay mysterious.
    Scientists exult in mystery for a different reason: it gives them
    something to do. ... one of the truly bad effects of religion is
    that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not
    understanding.

    -- p. 125

    Why is God considered an explanation for anything?  It’s not -
    it’s a failure to explain, a shrug of the shoulders, an ‘I dunno’
    dressed up in spirituality and ritual.  If someone credits
    something to God, generally what it means is that they haven’t a
    clue, so they’re attributing it to an unreachable, unknowable
    sky-fairy.  Ask for an explanation of where that bloke came from,
    and odds are you’ll get a vague, pseudo-philosophical reply about
    having always existed, or being outside nature.  Which, of course,
    explains nothing.

    -- “Ben”, from `an entry on his “Religion is Bullshit” blog
       <http://www.religionisbullshit.net/blog/2005/09/god-did-it-explains-nothing.php>`__,
       p. 134

    Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it
    from religious conviction.

    -- Blaise Pascal, p. 249

    Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet.

    -- Napoleon Bonaparte, p. 276

    Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as
    false, and by the rulers as useful.

    But what is so hard for us to understand is that ... *these people
    actually believe what they say they believe*.

    atrocities.

    -- Voltaire, p. 306

    Many people would sooner die than think.  In fact they do.

    -- Bertrand Russel, p. 306

    As long as we accept the principle that religious faith must be
    respected simply because it is religious faith, it is hard to
    withhold respect from the faith of Osama bin Laden and the suicide
    bombers.  The alternative, one so transparent that it should need
    no urging, is to abandon the principle of automatic respect for
    religious faith.  This is one reason why I do everything in my
    power to warn people against faith itself, not just against
    so-called ‘extremist’ faith.  The teachings of ‘moderate’
    religion, though not extremist in themselves, are an open
    invitation to extremism.

    -- p. 306

    More generally (and this applies to Christianity no less than to
    Islam), what is really pernicious is the practice of teaching
    children that faith itself is a virtue.  Faith is an evil
    precisely because it requires no justification and brooks no
    argument.  Teaching children that unquestioned faith is a virtue
    primes them — given certain other ingredients that are not hard
    to come by — to grow up into potentially lethal weapons for
    future jihads or crusades.

    -- p. 307

    If children were taught to question and think through their
    beliefs, instead of being taught the superior virtue of faith
    without question, it is a good bet that there would be no suicide
    bombers.

    -- p. 308

    Faith can be very very dangerous, and deliberately to implant it
    into the vulnerable mind of an innocent child is a grievous wrong.

    -- p. 308

    Children, I’ll argue, have a human right not to have their minds
    crippled by exposure to other people’s bad ideas — no matter who
    these other people are.  Parents, correspondingly, have no
    God-given licence to enculturate their children in whatever ways
    they personally choose: no right to limit the horizons of their
    children’s knowledge, to bring them up in an atmosphere of dogma
    and superstition, or to insist they follow the straight and narrow
    paths of their own faith.

    In short, children have a right not to have their minds addled by
    nonsense, and we as a society have a duty to protect them from it.
    So we should no more allow parents to teach their children to
    believe, for example, in the literal truth of the Bible or that
    the planets rule their lives, than we should allow parents to
    knock their children’s teeth out or lock them in a dungeon.

    -- Nicholas Humphrey, p. 326

    I thank my own parents for taking the view that children should be
    taught not so much *what* to think as *how* to think.  If, having
    been fairly and properly exposed to all the scientific evidence,
    they grow up and decide that the Bible is literally true or that
    the movements of the planets rule their lives, that is their
    privilege.  The important point is that it is *their* privilege to
    decide what they shall think, and not their parents’ privilege to
    impose it by *force majeure*.  And this, of course, is especially
    important when we reflect that children become the parents of the
    next generation, in a position to pass on whatever indoctrination
    may have moulded them.

    -- p. 327

    What can be more soul shaking than peering through a 100-inch
    telescope at a distant galaxy, holding a 100-million-year-old
    fossil or a 500,000-year-old stone tool in one’s hand, standing
    before the immense chasm of space and time that is the Grand
    Canyon, or listening to a scientist who gazed upon the face of the
    universe’s creation and did not blink?  That is deep and sacred
    science.

    -- Michael Shermer, p. 345

    I believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will
    survive.  I am not young and I love life.  But I should scorn to
    shiver with terror at the thought of annihilation.  Happiness is
    nonetheless true happiness because it must come to an end, nor do
    thought and love lose their value because they are not
    everlasting.  Many a man has borne himself proudly on the
    scaffold; surely the same pride should teach us to think truly
    about man’s place in the world.  Even if the open windows of
    science at first make us shiver after the cosy indoor warmth of
    traditional humanizing myths, in the end the fresh air brings
    vigour, and the great spaces have a splendour of their own.

    -- Bertrand Russell (1925 essay “What I Believe”), p. 354:

    If your pet is dying in pain, you will be condemned for cruelty if
    you do not summon the vet to give him a general anaesthetic from
    which he will not come round.  But if your doctor performs exactly
    the same merciful service for you when you are dying in pain, he
    runs the risk of being prosecuted for murder.  When I am dying, I
    should like my life to be taken out under a general anaesthetic,
    exactly as if it were a diseased appendix.  But I shall not be
    allowed that privilege, because I have the ill-luck to be born a
    member of *Homo sapiens* rather than, for example, *Canis
    familiaris* or *Felis catus*.  At least, that will be the case
    unless I move to a more enlightened place like Switzerland, the
    Netherlands or Oregon.  Why are such enlightened places so rare?
    Mostly because of the influence of religion.

    -- p. 357

    As many atheists have said better than me, the knowledge that we
    have only one life should make it all the more precious.  The
    atheist view is correspondingly life-affirming and life-enhancing,
    while at the same time never being tainted with self-delusion,
    wishful thinking, or the whingeing self-pity of those who feel
    that life owes them something.

    -- p. 361

    | That it will never come again
    | Is what makes life so sweet.

    -- Emily Dickinson, p. 361

    Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer
    than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose ... I suspect
    that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed
    of, or can be dreamed of, in any philosophy.

    -- J. B. S. Haldane, p. 364

    The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the
    surface of a gas-covered planet going around a nuclear fireball
    ninety million miles away and think this to be *normal* is
    obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to
    be.

    -- Douglas Adams, p. 364

    ‘Tell me,’ the great twentieth-century philosopher Ludwig
    Wittgenstein once asked a friend, ‘why do people always say it was
    natural for man to assume that the sun went round the Earth rather
    than that the Earth was rotating?’ His friend replied, ‘Well,
    obviously because it just looks as though the Sun is going round
    the Earth.’ Wittgenstein responded, ‘Well, what would it have
    looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?’ I
    sometimes quote this remark of Wittgenstein in lectures, expecting
    the audience to laugh.  Instead, they seem stunned into silence.

    -- p. 367

    Science flings open the narrow window through which we are
    accustomed to viewing the spectrum of possibilities.  We are
    liberated by calculation and reason to visit regions of
    possibility that had once seemed out of bounds or inhabited by
    dragons.

    -- p. 374

    I genuinely don’t know the answer, but I am thrilled to be alive
    at a time when humanity is pushing against the limits of
    understanding.  Even better, we may eventually discover that there
    are no limits.

=======================================

Below, other people quoted in `The Demon-Haunted World` are identified
by name and page number.  Direct quotes of Carl Sagan’s words only
show the page number.

    All our science, measured against reality, is primitive and
    childlike—and yet it is the most precious thing we have.

    -- Albert Einstein, p. 2

    Skepticism does not sell well.

    -- p. 5

    Men think epilepsy divine, merely because they do not understand
    it.  But if they called everything divine which they do not
    understand, why, there would be no end of divine things.

    -- Hippocrates, p. 8

    Leave nothing to chance.  Overlook nothing.  Combine contradictory
    observations.  Allow yourself enough time.

    -- Hippocrates, p. 8

    It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to
    persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.

    -- p. 12

    Except for hydrogen, all the atoms that make each of us up—the
    iron in our blood, the calcium in our bones, the carbon in our
    brains—were manufactured in red giant stars thousands of
    light-years away in space and billions of years ago in time.  We
    are, as I like to say, starstuff.

    -- p. 14

    Religions are often the state-protected nurseries of pseudoscience.

    -- p. 15

    Science is far from a perfect instrument of knowledge.  It is just
    the best we have.  In this respect, as in many others, it’s like
    democracy.  Science by itself cannot advocate courses of human
    action, but it can certainly illuminate the possible consequences
    of alternative courses of action.

    The scientific way of thinking is at once imaginative and
    disciplined.  This is central to its success.  Science invites us
    to let the facts in, even when they don’t conform to our
    preconceptions.  It counsels us to carry alternative hypotheses in
    our heads and see which best fits the facts.  It urges on us a
    delicate balance between no-holds-barred openness to new ideas,
    however heretical, and the most rigorous skeptical scrutiny of
    everything—new ideas and established wisdom.  This kind of
    thinking is also an essential tool for a democracy in an age of
    change.

    One of the reasons for its success is that science has built-in,
    error-correcting machinery at its very heart.  Some may consider
    this an overbroad characterization, but to me every time we
    exercise self-criticism, every time we test our ideas against the
    outside world, we are doing science.  When we are self-indulgent
    and uncritical, when we confuse hopes and facts, we slide into
    pseudoscience and superstition.

    Every time a scientific paper presents a bit of data, it’s
    accompanied by an error-bar—a quiet but insistent reminder that
    no knowledge is complete or perfect.  It’s a calibration of how
    much we trust what we think we know.  If the error bars are small,
    the accuracy of our empirical knowledge is high; if the error bars
    are large, then so is the uncertainty in our knowledge.  Except in
    pure mathematics, nothing is known for certain (although much is
    certainly false).

    Moreover, scientists are usually careful to characterize the
    veridical status of their attempts to understand the
    world—ranging from conjectures and hypotheses, which aer highly
    tentative, all the way up to laws of Nature which are repeatedly
    and systematically confirmed through many interrogations of how
    the world works.  But even laws of Nature are not absolutely
    certain.  There may be new circumstances never before
    examined—inside black holes, say, or within the electron, or
    close to the speed of light—where even our vaunted laws of
    Nature break down and, however valid they may be in ordinary
    circumstances, need correction.

    Humans may crave absolute certainty; they may aspire to it; they
    may pretend, as partisans of certain religions do, to have
    attained it.  But the history of science—by far the most
    successful claim to knowledge accessible to humans—teaches that
    the most we can hope for is successive improvement in our
    understanding, learning from our mistakes, an asymptotic approach
    to the Universe, but with the proviso that absolute certainty will
    always elude us.

    -- p. 27-28

    Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication
    in the word “spiritual” that we are talking of anything other than
    matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or
    anything outside the realm of science.  ...  Science is not only
    compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of
    spirituality.

    -- p. 29

    Science may be hard to understand.  It may challenge cherished
    beliefs.  When its products are placed at the disposal of
    politicians or industrialists, it may lead to weapons of mass
    destruction and grave threats to the environment.  But one thing
    you have to say about it: It delivers the goods.

    -- p. 30

    Think of how many religions attempt to validate themselves with
    prophecy.  Think of how many people rely on the prophecies,
    however vague, however unfulfilled, to support or prop up their
    beliefs.  Yet has there ever been a religion with the prophetic
    accuracy and reliability of science?  There isn’t a religion on
    the planet that doesn’t long for a comparable ability—precise,
    and repeatedly demonstrated before committed skeptics—to
    foretell future events.  No other human institution comes close.

    -- p. 30

    Valid criticism does you a favor.

    -- p. 32

    Science, Ann Druyan notes, is forever whispering in our ears,
    “Remember, you’re very new at this.  You might be mistaken.
    You’ve been wrong before.”  Despite all the talk of humility, show
    me something comparable in religion.  Scripture is said to be
    divinely inspired—a phrase with many meanings.  But what if it’s
    simply made up by fallible humans?  Miracles are attested, but
    what if they’re instead some mix of charlatanry, unfamiliar states
    of consciousness, misapprehensions of natural phenomena, and
    mental illness?  No contemporary religion and no New Age belief
    seems to me to take sufficient account of the grandeur,
    magnificence, subtlety and intricacy of the Universe revealed by
    science.  The fact that so little of the findings of modern
    science is prefigured in Scripture to my mind casts further doubt
    on its divine inspiration.

    But of course I might be wrong.

    -- p. 35

    The difference between physics and metaphysics, [Robert W.] Wood
    concluded as he raised his glass high, is not that the
    practitioners of one are smarter than the practitioners of the
    other.  The difference is that the metaphysicist has no
    laboratory.

    -- p. 37

    An extraterrestrial being, newly arrived on Earth—scrutinizing
    what we mainly present to our children in television, radio,
    movies, newspapers, magazines, the comics, and many books—might
    easily conclude that we are intent on teaching them murder, rape,
    cruelty, superstition, credulity, and consumerism.  We keep at it,
    and through constant repetition many of them finally get it.  What
    kind of society could we create if, instead, we drummed into them
    science and a sense of hope?

    -- p. 39

    There are wonders enough out there without our inventing any.

    -- p. 59

    Those who have something to sell, those who wish to influence
    public opinion, those in power, a skeptic might suggest, have a
    vested interest in discouraging skepticism.

    -- p. 77

    Special cautions are necessary when the stakes are high.  We are
    not obliged to make up our minds before the evidence is in.  It’s
    permitted not to be sure.

    -- p. 180

    I’m frequently asked, “Do you believe there’s extraterrestrial
    intelligence?”  I give the standard arguments—there are a lot of
    places out there, the molecules of life are everywhere, I use the
    word *billions*, and so on.  Then I say it would be astonishing to
    me if there weren’t extraterrestrial intelligence, but of course
    there is as yet no compelling evidence for it.

    Often, I’m asked next, “What do you really think?”

    I say, “I just told you what I really think.”

    “Yes, but what’s your gut feeling?”

    But I try not to think with my gut.  If I’m serious about
    understanding the world, thinking with anything besides my brain,
    as tempting as that might be, is likely to get me into trouble.
    Really, it’s okay to reserve judgment until the evidence is in.

    Keeping an open mind is a virtue, but not so open that your brains
    fall out.

    Gullibility kills.

    -- p. 218

    Those who invalidate reason ought seriously to consider whether
    they argue against reason with or without reason; if with reason,
    then they establish the principles that they are laboring to
    dethrone: but if they argue without reason (which, in order to be
    consistent with themselves they must do), they are out of reach of
    rational conviction, nor do they deserve a rational argument.

    -- Ethan Allen, p. 255

    We are all flawed and creatures of our times.

    -- p. 259

    Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge:
    it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so
    positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved
    by science.

    -- Charles Darwin, Introduction, `The Descent of Man`, 1871

    Nature free at once and rid of her haughty lords is seen to do all
    things spontaneously of herself without the meddling of the gods.

    If you accept the literal truth of every word of the Bible, then
    the Earth must be flat.  The same is true for the Qu’ran.

    We must not believe the many, who say that only free people ought
    to be educated, but we should rather believe the philosophers who
