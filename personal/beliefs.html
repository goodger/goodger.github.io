<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Worldview</a></h1>
<p>I am a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism">humanist</a>/<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism">rationalist</a>/<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)">naturalist</a>, and therefore an
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheist</a>.</p>
<p>In the past I eschewed the label “atheist” because it describes only
an absence, a negative. If I label myself an atheist it would only
describe what I am <em>not</em>: I don’t believe in supernatural creators.
This is true, but it’s only the consequence of what I do believe,
which is much more important. When asked [e.g. on a census form] what
my religion is, I answer “none”; atheism is <em>not</em> a religion, it is
the <em>absence</em> of religion.</p>
<p>Now I embrace the label of atheist, as a shorthand for “agnostic to
the point of atheism”. Of course, it’s impossible to prove the
non-existence of a creator, as it is impossible to prove a negative
(“the absense of evidence is not evidence of absence”). However, as
Carl Sagan stated,</p>
<blockquote>
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</blockquote>
<p>The existence of a supreme being is a very extraordinary claim indeed,
and I have seen no convincingly extraordinary evidence to support it.
Anecdotes, feelings of awe, ancient scrolls, questionably-reported
history, tradition, the beliefs of others, and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps">ignorance</a>, are not
evidence.</p>
<p>(By the way, you’re an atheist too. Even if you believe in the
Judeo-Christian “God”, you certainly don’t believe in Osiris, or
Vishnu, or Zeus, or Odin, or Amaterasu, or any of the other gods of
human history. You’re an
Osiris/Visnu/Zeus/Odin/Amaterasu/etc.-atheist. So am I. I simply
believe in one god fewer, for a grand total of zero. It’s much simpler
that way.)</p>
<p>I am an ethical, moral person.  My ethics and morals come from
respect, love, and awe for the nature of the universe, society, and
for life itself.</p>
<p>I “believe” in science, but it is a rational and revisable belief,
based on evidence and reproducible, verifiable, and falsifiable
experiment. The essential difference, as I see it, is this: <strong>science
is evidence without faith, while religion is faith without evidence</strong>.
I try to remain open-minded: I am willing to entertain the idea that I
am wrong, and I am willing re-examine my beliefs, given compelling new
evidence.</p>
<p>Rather than stating “I believe in science,” it may be more accurate to
state that “I <em>trust</em> the process of science and the scientific
method,” because <a class="reference external" href="http://store.xkcd.com/xkcd/#Science"><strong>science works</strong></a>. Given enough time and resources, I
could reproduce the experiments and observations that have produced
our current understanding of the laws of nature. Is it complete? No,
but it’s more complete than it was yesterday, and will be more
complete tomorrow.</p>
<p>I am generally tolerant of religions, superstitions, and other
supernatural belief systems — even though I find them irrational and
misguided at best — as long as it is kept personal.  What I cannot
tolerate is someone imposing their worldview on me or on others.</p>

<p>A great book for new parents is <cite>The First Three Years of Life</cite>, by
Burton L. White.  Rather than giving a cookie-cutter recipie for all
kids (who are all different), it gives insight into the thought
processes of children from newborns to 3 years of age, and tips for
humane discipline.  A newborn’s cry is very different from a
1-year-old’s cry.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Children need structure and discipline in their lives.  They need to
have <em>clear</em> and <strong>enforced</strong> limits.</li>
<li>Corporal punishment is never the solution.  It is completely
unacceptable to strike a child (or an adult, except in
self-defense).</li>
<li>Children <em>will</em> test their limits.  But that’s a good sign, and
shouldn’t be discouraged <em>too</em> much.</li>
<li>Raising young children is a <em>more</em>-than-full-time job.  The ideal
child-raising environment includes at least one full-time parent.</li>
<li>Parents have to decide how much time to devote to their children,
and how much money they want to make.  It’s a compromise.</li>
<li>Full-time parenting is a hard job, and parents need breaks!</li>
<li>A license is required to drive a car, but not to raise a child.
That’s a real shame, because there are so many bad parents out
there.</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Marriage is a lifelong commitment.  If you’re not <em>absolutely</em>
committed to spending your <em>entire</em> life with your significant other,
don’t get married.</li>
<li>Many people enter into marriage lightly, and the high divorce rate
is the result.</li>
<li>Sometimes relationships can be hard, but you have to persevere.
Marriage does not allow for quitters.</li>
<li>Marriage implies — or should imply — <em>unconditional</em> love.</li>
<li>For better or for worse, in richer and in poorer... these are
<em>vows</em>.  They’re not just platitudes that can be ignored when they
prove inconvenient.</li>

yourself or have someone fix it for you.</p>
