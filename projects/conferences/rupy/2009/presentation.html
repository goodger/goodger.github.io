<p>Yesterday I was doing some sight-seeing, guided by Jakub Nowak, and
I noticed there's a street named after the American President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  I asked Jakub if there's a street named

<div class="spoken docutils container">
<p>My first exposure to Python came when I was working in Tokyo at a
small company doing SGML data processing, specializing in East
Asian languages (Japanese, Chinese, Korean). It was a high-stress
but fun environment, where the work always had to be done
<em>yesterday</em>. We'd write code and run it on client data (which was
usually garbage), and debug the system until it ran correctly.  As
soon as the job ran correctly, the job was done. There were a lot
of one-off programs, but many were not insignificant. A typical day
saw me coding in Scheme, PostScript, shell, and Perl. Lots of
Perl. From single-line filters to a multi-thousand-line program
that parsed ASCII-art syntax diagrams.  Pages and pages of
ASCII-art syntax diagrams.  I used to have nightmares about them.</p>
<p>I was immersed in Perl for over 2 years.</p>
<p>Perl used to fit my brain.  But by the end, I was sick of Perl; it
just didn't scale, and maintenance of my own code was a nightmare
(let alone other people's code).  And I think that I wrote good,
clean code!  After 2 and a half years of always-on coding, I was
burnt out.  My brain rejected Perl.</p>
<p>Toward the end of my stay in Japan, probably in 1997, a colleague
picked up a copy of the first (1996) edition of O'Reilly's
&quot;Programming Python&quot; by Mark Lutz and was impressed. I took a look
and liked what I saw, but was so busy that I didn't have time to
get into it then. I moved back to Canada in 1998 with my wife and
infant son, took some time off, picked up my own copy of
&quot;Programming Python&quot;, and delved deep. I really liked what I saw,
and started a Python rewrite of a project I'd written in university
in Pascal to learn the language. It was a Pentominoes puzzle
solver.</p>
<p>➔</p>
</div>
<p class="incremental">Pentominoes:</p>
<img alt="images/pentominoes-white.png" class="incremental align-center" src="images/pentominoes-white.png" />
<div class="spoken docutils container">
<p>Pentominoes are all possible shapes formed from 5 adjacent squares.
I'm sure you've seen their cousins, the tetrominoes -- they're the
shapes in the game Tetris.</p>
<p>I got the pentominoes solver program working well enough -- it was
slow and buggy, but the project had served its purpose: I was now
comfortable coding in Python.</p>
<p>With Python, the code flowed. Maintenance was a breeze. I found
myself writing code that would often <em>just work</em>, the first time.
As the saying goes, Python fits my brain. I was able to tackle
large projects much more easily than ever before. And thanks to
Python, programming became fun again.</p>
<p>Had I known about Ruby then, perhaps I would have embraced it as a
&quot;nicer Perl&quot;.  Who knows?  But I didn't know about it (even though
I lived in Japan when it was first developed!), and now I've grown
used to significant whitespace.  Ruby isn't for me, but to those of
you who love it, I say &quot;Great!&quot;  I'm happy that you have adopted
another open-source community-built language, growing the open
source community, instead of relying on something proprietary.</p>
<p>While first learning Python I discovered docstrings and started
looking around for autodocumentation systems to exploit them. The
choices available then weren't exactly what I was looking for. It
seemed that many people had tried their hand at autodocumentation, but
nobody had produced anything sufficiently generic for my
liking. Either the source code was imported (where I wanted it to be
parsed), or the output was fixed (it should be flexible), or the
markup was either deficient or cryptic and hard to read (it should be
rich, yet implicit and easy to read). I foolishly took on this task,
and eventually focused on the last aspect: the markup. Docutils &amp;
reStructuredText were born, and the rest is history
(<a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sf.net/docs/ref/rst/introduction.html#history">http://docutils.sf.net/docs/ref/rst/introduction.html#history</a>).</p>

generate Python's documentation (with Sphinx) and the Python.org
website.  Docutils can even be used to make slides; I used it for
these slides!</p>
<p>Docutils itself still doesn't do Python autodocumentation, but some
autodocumentation systems use Docutils, notably Epydoc and Sphinx.
Is one of them the &quot;ultimate autodocumentation tool&quot;?  Not sure

<li>as chair of PyCon 2008 &amp; 2009,</li>
<li>and as an officer and a Director of the Python Software Foundation.</li>

<p>I was nominated and elected to membership of the Python Software
Foundation in 2003. I became an officer (Assistant Secretary in
2005 and Secretary since 2006), and I was a Director from 2006 to
2009.  For almost a year I worked full-time for the PSF as
Conference Coordinator.</p>
<p>I now program almost exclusively in Python. A few years ago I
revisited my Pentominoes solver, using a different approach, which
works very well.  That project is called &quot;Polyform Puzzler&quot;:</p>

<p class="incremental big">1. Be a participant.</p>
<p class="incremental big">2. Don’t be a jerk.</p>
<div class="spoken docutils container">
Let's elaborate on these ideas.</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="be-a-participant">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Be a Participant</a></h1>
<div class="spoken docutils container">
<p>To help your community, be more than a user.  You need to give of
yourself.  Be an active participant.</p>
<p>The FOSS community can be thought of as a gift culture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A Linux operating system is worth between 30 Euros and billions.</p>
<p>30 Euros is about the cost of a pre-installed Windows operating
system, so the value of Linux to end-users is at least that much.</p>
<p>Ohloh.net says the Linux 2.6 kernel is worth over $137,000,000, or
92 million Euros.</p>
<p>Add in all the applications that come with a typical Linux
distribution, and the total value is easily in the billions.  All
free to us.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Python and Ruby are free, but both took uncounted thousands of
person-hours to build.  All this time, freely given to us.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you give, or do you only take?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with being a consumer of
Free and Open Source software projects.  There is no compulsion for
anyone to participate.  But to make the community better, active
participation is the key.</p>
<p>Participation can take many forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can write code, fix bugs, or help diagnose bugs.</li>
<li>You can report bugs!</li>
<li>You can write documentation.</li>
<li>You can help people out on mailing lists and other forums.</li>
<li>You can tell people about your favorite projects, or about Free &amp;
open source software in general.</li>
<li>You can attend conferences, like this one -- there won't be a
conference if nobody comes!</li>
</ul>
<p>One measure of a project's success is the number of people using it!
And not everybody can be a core developer.  Today's consumer may be
tomorrow's contributor!</p>
<p>I'm not a C coder -- any more (by choice).  So I can't contribute
code to the core Python interpreter, which is written in C.  But I
volunteered in other ways, allowing a bit more time for the core
developers to do their work.  Thus I benefit from those who <em>are</em> C
coders -- their work protects me from unnecessary suffering.</p>
<p>Give freely and honestly.  Be generous.  Don't give with the
expectation of getting anything back.  If you expect a return, it
won't come.</p>
<p>I think that if it's free &amp; honest, no matter how much you give, you
get back far more.  The more you give, the more you are given,
freely.  People recognize honest generosity.</p>

<div class="spoken docutils container">
<p>The PyCon conference grow from about 400 attendees in 2006, to 600
attendees in 2007, to over 1000 in 2008.  In 2008 the conference
hotel wasn't big enough to handle over 1000 Pythonistas, and keep
them happy.  The main problem was the lack of dining space: there
wasn't enough space for everyone to sit down to a proper hot lunch.
So we had boxed lunches, and people were sitting in the hallways,
anywhere they could find a spot.</p>
<p>By this time, we already had a contract with this hotel for
PyCon 2009.  We fully expected attendance to grow further -- maybe
not a 75% increase again, but we expected 1200 people in 2009.  So
we decided to add a second nearby hotel.  This was a big risk.  Had
there been a disaster, it could have wiped out the PSF's finances.</p>
<p>As it was, the fall of 2008 saw a huge financial crisis in the
United States.  We had trouble getting sponsors for PyCon 2009.  And
we saw a 10% decline in attendance.  The net result was that we lost
some money.  A significant amount, but not enough to bankrupt the
PSF.</p>
<p>When I chaired the conference in 2008, I found that the job had
grown to the point where it wasn't feasible for a volunteer to
handle.  Also, there were a lot of things the PSF wanted to do but
didn't have the time for.  So I proposed that the PSF hire me, and
they did.  Unfortunately, with the loss from PyCon, the PSF Board of
Directors decided they couldn't afford to keep me on the payroll, so
my employment ended in September.</p>
<p>And although I no longer work full-time for the PSF, I still help
with PyCon, and I'm still the Secretary.</p>

<div class="spoken docutils container">
<p>Traditional marketing &amp; hype don't work with developers and other
techno-geeks.</p>
<p>(<em>added 2009-11-08</em>) Alternative explanation: Geeks are naturally
skeptical.  Hype will be examined closely and carefully, and if the
reality doesn't match up to the hype, your project (and your own)
reputation will suffer.  Great volumes of ridicule will follow.</p>
<p>At a one of the PyCons in Dallas, 2006 I think, after our conference
days were over many people stayed for a few more days to work on
projects: we call these &quot;development sprints&quot;.  A group of
vacuum-cleaner salespeople moved in to the big rooms for their
conference.  It seemed to consist of people on stage yelling at the
crowd to &quot;Give 110%!&quot;  And the crowd yelled back, making as much
noise as they could.  They even had noise-makers, plastic clapping
hands.</p>

<p>This is an important, higher-level version of &quot;don't be a jerk&quot;.</p>
<p>At every PyCon, we are always trying new ideas.  Over the years we
have added tutorial days, plenary sessions for lightning talks, and
invited summit meetings.  We increased the number of tracks to 4 and
this year, to 5.  This year we will also have a poster session.</p>
<p>In 2008, we tried making the conference more valuable to our
sponsors.  We added an expo hall for sponsors to interact directly
with attendees.  We added sponsorship to each keynote talk (I said
&quot;this talk is sponsored by XYZ Corp.  XYZ makes great software to do
ABC.  And they're hiring!&quot;).  We put aside one lightning talk slot
for each sponsor.</p>
<p>Well, the expo hall worked out fine.  Those that were interested
went, and those that weren't, didn't.  But the talk sponsorship and
sponsor lightning talks didn't work well at all.  There was a lot of
blowback, or negative feedback, from the community.</p>
<p>We made a mistake.  We learned our lesson, and toned down
sponsorship in 2009.  We had snacks in the expo hall, which made the
sponsors happy.  But we didn't have any forced commercial messages.
We respected the community.  PyCon 2009 was widely hailed as the
best ever.</p>
<p>Here's another example.  Every year at PyCon we give each attendee a
conference bag which contains a conference T-shirt and materials
from our sponsors.  Traditionally, people who arrive early will help
stuff these bags: we create a long assembly line, and each person
grabs a bag and fills it with one of each item.  I thought this was
a tedious exercise, so in 2008 I suggested that we use a temporary
employment agency to hire some locals to do the stuffing for us.
The objections came swiftly and loudly: the bag stuffing was a
cherished event, a social gathering to begin the conference.</p>
<p>Had I gone ahead and hired people, it would have been disrespecting
the community.  By asking first, I showed respect, and learned a
valuable lesson.</p>
