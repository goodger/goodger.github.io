   below, or no link to a particular format, it means that I do not
   have files for that presentation.  Please do not write to ask for
   them, because **they do not exist!** If I do prepare files, I will
   post them here.


PyCon
=====

I have been particularly involved with PyCon_, the annual U.S. Python
community conference, so `my presentations at PyCon have their own
page <../pycon/>`__.

PyCon India 2010
================

I was invited to give a keynote talk at PyCon India 2010 in Bangalore,
titled `Python in India`.  I also gave a talk about my `Polyform
Puzzler`_ project.


RuPy 2009
=========

`RuPy <http://rupy.eu>`__ is the "strongly dynamic conference"
featuring talks about Ruby, Python, and other languages and
technologies.  I was invited to give a "community-oriented talk"
at RuPy 2009 in Poznan, Poland, billed as a keynote:

* `The story of my visit to Poznan (blog post)
  <http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=276019>`__
* Video of my RuPy 2009 talk `via rupy.blip.tv
  <http://rupy.blip.tv/file/3011513/>`__ or `via mefeedia.com
  <http://www.mefeedia.com/watch/26976224>`__ (the beginning of the
  video is a bit messed up, but persevere, it's soon fixed)
* `Plain HTML handout/script <rupy/2009/handout.html>`__
* `S5 HTML slideshow <rupy/2009/presentation.html>`__ (use the arrow keys

MontrealPython
==============

I gave a talk about my `Polyform Puzzler`_ project at the first
meeting of the Montreal Python users group on February 7, 2008.  It
was a lot of fun, and the group seemed to enjoy it.

OSCON
=====

In 2007 I was invited to present my tutorial, `Code Like a Pythonista:
Idiomatic Python <../pycon/2007/idiomatic/>`__, at OSCON__.  This was
a revised encore presentation (to a different and larger audience) of
a tutorial I had presented at `PyCon 2007 <../pycon/#2007>`__.
