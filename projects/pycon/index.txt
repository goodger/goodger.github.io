PyCon_ is the annual North American Python community conference, first
held in 2003, organized and staffed by community volunteers, and
underwritten by the `Python Software Foundation
<http://www.python.org/psf/>`__.  I attended my first PyCon_ in 2004
in Washington D.C.  I was "on staff" from the beginning, helping out
more each year.  I was the Chair of `PyCon 2008`__ and `PyCon 2009`__,
both held in Chicago.

I contribute to the `PyCon weblog <http://pycon.blogspot.com/>`_.

   Please do not write to ask for them, because **they do not exist!**
   If I do prepare files, I will post them here.
